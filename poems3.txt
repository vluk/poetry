The Book of Shadows by Deborah Paredez

Out of darkness swan song
drawn the ivy’s color.

The white moth, confident,
was playing with my toes

and my little books.

What happens
if we’re smart?

If we’re smart,
prunes the heart
and leaves the flesh

behind.

The heart is the time
when vision is most vivid.

The heart is the time
when we get most done.

When we are
at home in our caves

preparing to welcome the new year,
or when we

are playing in our own caves,
we play the heart.

When I shout
from the stairs,

"Hurry, Uncle,
we have to hurry,"

he leaps from the window
and hooves the door,

and I see him trot to the stove,
and he’s done it all.

The Black Doll in the Garden by Charlotte Mew

The way she walks
as if she’s not moving,
plans to give it up

and so it goes without saying
that the first and third seasons
are the problem here.

Uncle Ben says, “Carrots,
you’re lucky I don’t
get the hickory nuts,
my meatball has been missing
the bone.”

The white-haired Dutch maid
upholds her vegetables in every
airy space, still
holding up the little coffin

of a kitchen table.
Do I have a question for you?
“What goes around comes around,”
she says.

It’s amazing how soon
the cat’s out, how many times

I’ve been called a fool,
how many times I’ve been
called a n*****, but can’t
answer any of those questions.

Sonnet 12 by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

He had a son, and he gave him
A name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name,
And he gave him a name, and he gave him a name!
Does the child know the name?
But some of them are true,
And some of them are false!


Some of them are true,
And some of them are false!

I know what my body’s like,
the real thing,
the kind rarely
seen,

the kind everyone
knows,

the kind we want

to give up,
the kind

often unwanted.
What I want

to be is

what people expect,
the kind of

glamorous

pretty,

gentle

nice,


exotic,

sexual,

or sacred,

only my body can

be what I want.

Long Distance by David J. McCune

We’ve got the most beautiful woman
in the world and her husband is a saint
but Joe is a slob, an old fool
and his turd keeps on breaking down

in our kitchen. So we sit around the fire
talking to ourselves
and listening to the weather
and the birds and the music

of the wind as we walk
and everyone forgets
that there is a giant god
in the picture book
we could have bought
but we ran out of change
and had to start over

its home away from home
broken down into miniatures
chewing on each other’s hair

the madcap way we weave our way
to an imaginary moon

the giant ship we’ve built
stealing sandwiches and handshakes
that never happened

or was never supposed to happen
but it has and it continues

A for the Devil by Vachel Lindsay

kissed my cheek, and I was in the car.

United States of It by Ilya Kaminsky


We are not varied enough.
We need to be reminded that we are not

different enough. We have the ears,
the eyes, the hands,

the questions to ask. We will ride with

the bus stop or the train.
We will stand at the entrance,

pointing to a man with a ponytail,

or in the shop window,

a sweater, a jacket,

a pair of socks,

and if we sit alone,

we will see each other

and think of all the ways

we have been ignored,
of all the people we have

told to shut up about

and not to say anything about. To

be careful not to be

wrong, not to praise or

burden ourselves with questions.

The Dream of the Lost Duck by Michael Ryan

I’ve been in the woods for hours, a different room from the one
I’d been sleeping in all day, and the duck has fallen to the ground
Lying there in the dark, wobbly and out of breath,
I now hear myself humming and the goose’s nest has been seen
I’ve been in the woods all day, and the duck has been seen
I’ve been in the woods all day, and the duck has fallen to the ground
Lying there in the dark, wobbly and out of breath,
I now hear myself humming and the goose’s nest has been seen

I’ve been in the woods all day, and the duck has fallen to the ground
“I’m not in the woods,” or ”I’m in the woods,” the duck cries
I’m going to get away for my life
and the goose stays in her position,
I put my hand to my heart like a baby”
and I yell out “It’s okay!”
The duck keeps her duck-like goblet down the hot alleyways
somewhere near Main and Capitol,
someplace like that.

A Postcards from the Hanging Gardens by Wayne Koestenbaum

The first postcards I saw
from the Hanging Gardens came
from the Bronx
and were mostly wet
raccoon-colored and smelling
of cologne and coffee,
with the occasional space
where I could see the dark
of fleshy hair.

And the second? It was
from Athens, the same field
where I'd once tried to pick
a rose off a tree and missed,
and a half-mile away
from where I'd tried to
spray perfume on flowers
from a distance of twenty feet
and, after a look,
said there was a girl there
who liked flowers,
and that was after
a year of visa trouble
at the airport,
and I believed
her hair and makeup
were fake and fake
and that was a mistake,
because now I'm not
sure if I was in Greece
or if it was Houston
but I'm pretty sure
it was Manhattan,
it was Philadelphia
but maybe Brooklyn
or Queens, or some
other place I was just
certain I was on a train
going somewhere
I wanted to go,
I didn't know what
I was doing there.

Adventure of a Cold Theory
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Megan Snyder

I work in the seabed off the coast of Barents
where I can see a train going nowhere fast

and thought to myself: “If I come here
and stand on the platform, where does a man

get up and get to his car, how would I know?”

The answer is, he doesn’t.

And so I sit there
holding my silver moon pistol,

where the sea is quiet,

and perhaps the wind is blowing
from the north.

Daughters by Robert W. Service

My mother's daughters
should have lived at home
and had the fun.

The too-small sisters had
to prepare for the day
that they, too, would have to go
to work.

I had a problem
with the way that my mother
asked me
to come too

and take care of the house
for her.

The problem
was that

I didn’t know
what the house
was really

was scared

this being
the first time I’d
been to school

I had
to go along under

“In the old world we used to do things ” by Na no-mah by Bernard H. Weaver

In the old world we used to do things like sing karaoke.
We used to drive to the beach and sing karaoke.

We used to sit on fire, and sing karaoke.

We used to eat some delicious ambrosia,
but we used to do things like sing karaoke.

We used to have parties all over the town,
but we used to do things like sing karaoke.

In the old world we used to do things like drive

In the old world we used to do things like go
to the NHK and do great things with our lives.

In the old world we used to do things like eat delicious food,

In the old world we used to do things like drive

The Prodigal Son by William Butler Yeats

My Master,
With hard heart
I have overcome
The myriad obstacles
Of the dark world,
And have done my best,
Sure, though I fail in some
Or other,
To do my best I go on
The wide road,
While I am a slave.

I have done my best,
And yet the great task
That great task has done
To me:

World is not my mistress;
I have done my best,
But what I have done,
For all this,
I will not say;
I will not say;

I have done my best,
But not my best,
And this is my heart
That will go forward.

A Little Glimpse by Mark Waldron

He took me to his house
and had me step on his knee.

He gave me some shoes.

He took me to bed where
the air was cool.

He closed the door.

The door was open.

He wore slacks.

The light came on
glinting in the bedroom.

I used to love to run

through the fields, through the ranches
and the prairies.

He provided me with a good bed.

He took me to bed for a long

night.

I made love with him
like a gentle woman may.

I put my ear to his back.

He was in love with me.

I knew I was there.

The sky was gray.

He was on his own.

I heard the rain
hissing in the house.

I was thinking

about how I learned to love

a dog, how I learned
to love the people in the house.

I was thinking

about the little girl
who had difficulty standing
and was eventually carted off on a horse

that came to the end of the road

and had no name.

I was thinking

about how I learned
to love the wind

and the telltale bubbles
that rise to meet the fender.

Live by George Oppen

The only thing I’ve learned while I’ve been dead is to lie down with my shadow.
I’m sure there’s tension somewhere in the house,
but I’ve never been able to make myself clear,
calibrating the car’s odometer, fingering the wires
of my shower head, deciding which of us will die
next.

No, there’s a better way:
I’ll pin my life back into a box
and leave it there for the storm to sweep through,
the smoke to linger in the window, the trees
to snap at the slightest breeze, the hair
to fall back into its place at the back of my head
and be swept away.

River by W. S. Merwin

The river that we walk into
divides the night into three
circumference of light,

radio stations, a pile of teeth
distinguishing them, meaningless
walls, a child’s naked back.

I see you’re moving
in the wake of two horses
bent on moving

&amp; whistling to each other
in the wake of a train
&amp; whistling to each other

ahead of the night
two black horses

broughtailing the van
&amp; singing to each other
in the dark

dresses in the wake of a horse
pulling the rider
out of the van

&amp; singing to each other
in the dark

   Launch Audio in a New Window by CAConrad

I just want to thank you
for the bright lights and the clothes.
For the shoes and clothes for the hit men.
For my husband’s hard work and the men who loved him.

For your hair and the ties and the lipstick and your smile and your sweetness.
For your antibiotic and the men who died.

For your hopeful idealism and the men who walked away.

I will never forget the quality of the sunlight on
your windowsill. I will never forget the soft curls of
the pennies you drop on my head.

I will never forget the shoes I wear
when I walk down the street. I will not forget
the daddy and mommy I miss. I will not be
sorry for anyone on this earth.

This is a humbling song.
I am here in this small room
with a book and a TV.

If you take me back to the beginning
of my life, the beginning of
my love and my marriage,
I’ll be right back with you.

A Poem by Mark Twain

A Poem is a lovely thing;
Few can say the better word:
In the Poem, the Word makes clear
The keen and terrible sense;
The Heart is a riveted thing;
Muck, sponge, and tempest are
The three horsemen of the procession;
The Way is a Lamb;
The Courage is a Sheep;
The Sun is a Lion,
The Rain is a Dove,
And the Son is the Lamb.

A Poem is simply a Word;
A Poem is a lovely thing;
If it be thy heart, then let it grow;
If it be thy heart, then leave it;
For to me is the Glory
Of my terrible Poem, the Word.

To enjoy a little time by William Carlos Williams

To enjoy a little time
In English is to be glad

That you have not yet forgotten
For your joy’s sake.

To enjoy a little time
Wears out the full effect

Of time to the fullest:
Love’s pain has come true.

To enjoy a little time
Is to be indignant

That the past has gone
In vain.

To enjoy a little time
Is to be disappoint

That your life’s not worth
The while you waste.

The things I see, the friend I make,
the way I share your bed,
have nothing to do with me.
When you’re ready
to go, there’s no need to thank
me.

They’re only there to protect,
to be a pair of eyes,
to be lips,
to be lips.

what it means to be a woman in a world that isn’t

I Don't Want to Muck with a Thing by Scott Cairns

I don't want to muck with a thing,
a whited piece of trash. I don't want to muck
with a paper-thin curtain of air,
to step outside
into the morning and walk barefoot

through the pocked-off courtyard
of a house that wasn't
quite it anymore than I was before.

I don't want to muck with the house
that’s behind me, broken up
by setbacks and empty walls

in storage, in the way
it used to be, odd and
wanting to know what’s up ahead,
what’s that punk nicked

thing up there that’s ugly
and old and and big and
unfinished?

Flint would have us believe
that we are in the heart of a forest
too bright to be the sky. And the way

were attired in flannel
and moving, so graceful,
made of the thin-bodied
I’ve been looking for, though
she, with the hair in her ear,
cannot remember
the name of the dead, I said
to myself. The tree

the sun was singing
against, we were

watching from the shadows
the moon and the stars
were there, but
the moon was

not to be found,
not even near

the mountains
where the sea
had been a whim
and where waves

had been placed
to impede navigation.

The White Brandy by Fanny Howe

Look, here is a woman
reciting of a vulgar script,
spreading her legs, guessing
what I’m thinking. I’m too old to make
erotic faces at the time, too far from home
to do the things I’m doing today,
so I remain unrecognized.

Here is a woman
nearly impossible to sit beside
who’s destined to be a statue,

who’ll never know how lucky she was
and how much she was meant to do
in this life to make it happen,

how she was there before the revolution
and kept me safe during its height,
staying just long enough to teach me the alphabet,

how I can remember what it was like
at the time I used to be in this photo,
how I can still feel the warmth of her skin,
how I can still feel her tender body

and her fiery smile, and the way she’s singing,
it’s as if I’m letting her take me home,
remembering the old days,

remembering how easy it was
to forget who I used to be,
to look in the mirror,
remembering the books I’ve read,
remembering the things I’ve done
without thinking about myself.

Antiquities are coming. They are stranger, and they are cheaper, than we have thought:

a fitful, and that to one who has come to love

but never has come to know;

the eager officials, the bumbling clergy, the odd jokes,

the general absence of any passion, no end to it,

the constant fear of getting up, the constant need to stay up

and remember, to be the one who sleeps in it.

Half brown, half brown, I am black,

There are black buildings
on half brown streets, black cars
driving on brown roads.

The only black friend,
the only black soul
I know.

He's white, but he’s not;
he’s white, but he’s not.

Around my neck,
around my mind,
I can hear myself singing
about black people,
cursey and black.

It’s been a dream

to feel black, to have been black.

When I am black, I am proud.
When I am black, I am brave.

going back into the valley
and over the bridge.

I remember
the valley
and your duck
tent,
the cool bed
you made
for me at the

and how

I made
a joke about
throwing away
the fish I caught
that night

that nobody
had ever seen
or that
I had
probably caught
and thrown
from the top
when the light was
on.

And then
it was
morning
again
and I
was
still
undressed
which
wasn’t
true.

But
the run
had worn
out its welcome
and
I had
no
tent
that made
a windy
stand
the way
that it was

and I
was
thinking
of
running
again

and
then
I said
to myself
“you’re

There is no tears in this poem.

Therefore it is not sad.

For the last time I am ready to be sad

like the last time I was miserable.

When I was absolutely miserable the first time around

I pulled the trigger which plunged me into

a dark place I looked to the inside of my fist

where I was NOT prepared to be happy.

I was prepared to be miserable the very way I am going to

leave this poem behind.

The Snail by Robin Ekiss

The snail's a borrowed word.
The snail’s a word borrowed from
a word, from the Latin word for liquid.
The snail’s a word borrowed from
another word, from the Latin word for
foot. The snail’s a word borrowed from
another word, from the Latin word for
mouth. The snail’s a word borrowed from
a word borrowed from another word.
The snail’s a borrowed word.

I am the snail. I am my own
skeleton, my own skin, my own
flesh, my own egg-laying machine.

I am the snail. I’ve been
jumped on by a gene. I’ve been

steaming and crawling and annoyed
like the little fat lady in the squirrel-
holidays picture, scraping the
craw from the sandbox until the mud
is fresh and the carpet is clean.

I am the snail. I’m back and
still happy. I’m back and
not the little fat lady in the squirrel-
holidays picture. I’m back.

The House of the Sunrise by Jorge Luis Borges

The house of the sunrise
Is sacred,
The Madrid sky
The most beautiful sky
In the world,

The sunset
Is the same too
Astute,

Still, it is too short
To be a milky way
To live long

In a world of one day
And eight nights,

Lying peacefully
In a rectangle
Pushing the yellow road,

Quietly watching the sea
At night,
I sit at my desk
On a chair
Of my own

Eat Milagro
I can’t run anymore
I have died so many times

But I always forget
The time I died
Before my own death,

And when I make a joke,
The girl at my window
With unusual beauty
Told me once that

To be honest
I am not convinced
That the sun will come again.

Branches by Jessica Greenbaum

I’ve never been in the woods
but this honeybee hive in my attic strikes me
as more house than field. Lonely and nearly forgotten

I snarl and thump in the breeze
like the severed head of a bonfire, then go home
and close the door, watch the grid of leaves

whoops for each other but no one home.
I don’t know where you are, I don’t know
how to get there, I don’t know

what you’re going to do, if you ever do

First of May by Nicole Wilson

You could fight the heat at the May Day Parade
but it’s not your birthday, you’re not even at your best.
You could swear you’re one of the masked fighters
who flashed their paint-on-skin brims and waved
a white flag. You could tell the parade organizers
you were there, that you fought bravely, that you’re
the only one who earned our loyalty. But you
couldn’t name the leader, could only name the leader.
It’s a gag. It’s a guarantee. You’re
the only guy who would wear an upside-down
skirt to the May Day Parade, that’s how it is.
You’re the only guy who would give up his life
to protect the May Day Parade, you’re the only guy
who would call it quits at the end of every single transgression.
You’re the only guy who gave up your life
for the sake of the May Day Parade, and it’s not fair.

What I said in October, for you by David Wojahn

The surf references don’t apply.
The horizon’s a sea
though its emptiness grows

and ends
but a killing wind

that’ll draw you to its source
which is always

southwest

the sea

invents itself

as anachronistic

an aquemarine sky

that’s like

a man

stuck to a shore

that’s like

a cruel ocean

that’ll make you

believe

you’re

in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean

that’s like

a river

stuck

to a rock

that’s like

a boat

unstoppable

and it’ll

be like

the sea

creatures

from

The Haunting of Hill House

The Ship's Turret by Kara Walker

What I find most beautiful about what is left of what we have is the tremendous space
in which we have not been. We are a scrub in a wall, and there is a wall
in the middle of the room, the complete absence of which is

so beautiful, yet also full of things---there are no tarred
curtains on the wall, no doors barred or boarded. The walls

are always clean and neatly packed, the furniture is always in a cupboard,
like an armadillo, or an iguana. There are no torches

or hands, the door must always be unlocked, the bed,
the stove, the clothesline, the lefthand, the pegboard--all these things

are empty of anything, if we have to keep inventing and inventing,
while the walls are picked clean of all the old things that we need to be—

the lace we weave, the ruffle we thread, the cover of a box of tissues---all these
are things that were, are, or will be, and that must remain

The Hand-To-Hand Slayer by David Wojahn

I’ve dropped nearly $25,000
for a body of work that’s done
mostly, although I’ve had sex

with one or two stabs at it,
and I know it isn’t easy.
I been pimping like mad

and never finished, I’ve worked
many a job on the old,

I have no money left over
for rent, and I’ve worked

for free, and there’s nothing
you can do but wait for

to arrive to a pda,
and nothing you can do

is going to get you
to that point where you look

like a fool, and your tone
is going to sound like a fool,

and the next thing you know
you’re in a headlock,

in a barbed-wire room,
a picket line,

and you’re near a chair
where you’re going to sit
and then you’re off.

Facts of the Unconscious by William Blake

A child has a cacodemon,
As I have said,
A horse and ox and horseman’s cart,
And the carol the pyramids,
And the cat of the sea,
The sunset the lion,
And the flattery that I can drink,
The dancing of the two-headed dogs,
And the song of the ten-headed cats,
And the saying of a child,
All these and more
These and much more

are latent in my people.
The child has bit my ear,
The horse and ox and horseman’s cart,
And the pyramids and new cars,
And the lion and the flattery
And saying of a child,
All these and much more

are latent in my people.
The child has bitten my toe,
The horse and ox and horseman’s cart,
And the carol in the sunset
And the flattery in the dance
And the saying of a child,
All these and much more

are latent in my people.
The child has bit my foot,
The horse and ox and horseman’s cart,
And the pyramids and the lion
And saying of a child,
All these and much more

are latent in my people.

From the Dancehall by Svengali Greenbaum

Look for the advance,
the wishful look,
familiar gestures,

the wavy lines,
the low-cut

tailoring
of the gown or
the surprised
expression of the shoulders

from that gown’s most important points,
the way the hand

is moved during
the posing

and the shot.

And how
the feet

show on the

snowboard
or what looks

like the dead
foot or other

burly feet

and their

singing.

So first
you get the look

of pride and then

you get to know

the other women’s

gowns, the

chiffon, all

the other details
of the dance

with the camera,
the way

the breeze

flickers

from the ceiling
to the

breaking water,

the way

the dances

out of doors
into

the dancing

in the

unlit

sunroom.

The White Pine by James Laughlin

I was with a friend one night. Each
night, in the dark, I awake
and gaze upon the stone face
of the pine

I was with a friend.

The white face
of the pine

was empty

&amp; no body

could be in sight

but I could hear my friend

say

“there’s a pine
in the woods”

He shared the dream

that the pine

was in the woods.

He shared the dream

with me,

that the white pine

was in the woods.

I want to thank

James Laughlin

for this poem

I’m the one who

looks for the pine and

the pine

is lost.

Sometimes

a woman

who looks for

ah-knee creek

has no idea

what she’s looking

for.

From the Watermound by Robert W. Service

Since I was born in a trailer park,
I’ve had a lot of trouble
finding my place. I had trouble
finding my way home,
or even finding my own.
Inexplicably, I was "lazy,"
visually short and ugly,
 I couldn’t read or write,
and my classmates teased me.
They’re all gone now,
but the watermound stays,
and the riverbanks still blow.
The sound of it remains
even though we’re moving out.
There’s the finish line,
the finish line is here,
and the finish line is here,
and the end of the race.

There’s the finish line
even though we’re moving
out. The riverbanks stay,
the river stays,
and the river stays,
and the river stays,
and the river stays,
and the winner’s still
running.

A Stoic by William Butler Yeats

Rhetoric alone cannot erode a man's feelings,
But it can cleanse them, and it can make them blind.
It can make them aware of all their own fears,
And realize a great mystery:
That it is not love I despise, but fear that gives
Love its dark side, and its light side.

I can see from your face that apart from instinct
I love you, and my fire for you
Burns in the rest of my heart.
My love is greater than this, and I will endure
The cruelest of love: That is my life.

The Two Houses by Stanley Moss

Move him.

The Last Call by Brenda Shaughnessy

I was walking in a grassy clearing here
when I was hit by a car
and died. The hospital,
years later, came to the clearing
to do a memorial
but had just come from
the highway. I’m sitting here
whenever I hear the carry-on
comes and goes, my shoes
stuck to my feet,
and the funeral home
I’m often told to go to.

I have a name for that
--it’s the cushion
after each footfall--
that gives the body
its peace,

that’s not
a raggedy coat
that can be
dressed up
but the ground
inside your head
still burns.

I am saying this now
because I recall
the day my brother
was hit by a car
and died
when I was walking
along the other side
of the clearing
when I was hit
by a car.

A Chorus by Mona Zafar

Where has the chorus gone?
What has been its destination?
Who sowed confusion among the choristers?
Who dislikes the choristers of the masses?
Who is the hero and who the demon?
Who loves and mocks and who doesn’t?
Whose song, the chaos, and those in the middle
are the ears of the orchestra?
Who is the new guitarist and who will sing the old one?
Who is the new singer and who will sing the old one?
Who is the chorister that has been sown with lilies
and the new one has already been sown with tulips and lights?

Who will be the new guitarist and who will be the old one?
Who is the new singer and who is the old one?
Who is going to be the chorister that has been sown with lilies
and the old one has already been sown with tulips and lights?

The Transfixing by Anonymous

I have a dream I have put my hands to
the jail, not by God, but by whomsoever.

It is a sin and it is incomprehensible.
A skull, a frame of stone,
a chair for the body of the guilty
is not fit for the sight.

I have a dream I am a man in a wardrobe,
a gray tapestry, a cave of mirrors,
a florist’s garden of gossip.

I have a dream I have put my hands to,
God, to divine the face of God.

It is a sin and it is incomprehensible.
A shawl, a glass of milk, a pie,
a cold, wet newspaper, a Koran.

I have a dream I have put my hands to,
God, to denounce the face of God.

It is a sin and it is incomprehensible.
A steak, a glass of milk, a bowl of rice,
a chair for the body of the guilty.

I have a dream I have put my hands to
to crucify God.

It is a sin and it is incomprehensible.
A man, a chair, a playground, a beach
where I can let my fat legs hang,

where I can drink, where I can smoke, where
I can sleep, where I can go to the store,
where I can be a man in a wardrobe,

where I can be a Jew, a Jew
who goes to the synagogue on Tuesday,
the Sabbath, when the sun goes down,
where I can kiss a synagogue on the cheek

and say, “I walk to him.”

The Most Unbearable by Anonymous

Unbearable, unwonted, unforgiving, endless,
A cold, companionship, unending,
The longing to be free, unclasped, unbounded,
The absolute besieged, the unending,
In bloody battles, faced with both air and fire,
The free enemy with full arms, and the unending,
The free enemy with full arms, O despair!

A Promise by John Brehm

As a child, I was more
than a certain flower

I was an old dog

I had spent all night in

my luck

I was a dog

I had lost my hand

I walked in a small forest

for the promise

to come back

I went through banks

for four days

I did it

I searched

for a snake with a great yellow

foot

I carried it

and my love

to the moon

I returned

to see a girl on a train

wearing a red dress

I wanted to kiss her

and she was crying

I was shaking her

I said

I love you
and kissed her

Notes on the Theater by Katerina Rossetti

While the Orphic games and the Thanksgiving feast
esquire our attention by their offerings,

the two-step, the sword fight, the naked

dead end, the profanity-laced performance

and the humiliation of our auditors who

massaged our auditors' books: a troupe

flexes under a faucet and spits

out an aroma of coal, the taste

of lead, the smell of treacle, and

fleshy tea, and the sight of the audience

being pushed to the back: a sea of naked

huskins in the amphitheater, a sea of

girls and their clothes, faces

ornaments, champagne glasses,

and an assembly of old and young

girls and their girlfriends, in case

of some eventual catastrophe, dressed

in sexy stuff and acting in a play.

The best is over, the best is not

done: the first act is almost over.

Let us see if we can keep our

house in order, in order

to live, to get to the end of the stage.

From the Shadow by David Wojahn

the noon sun
splashed across her skin
and the familiar smells of cabbage and milk
ran through the recesses of her voice.

the airplanes
kept flying overhead
beneath her eyelids.

she held her hands over her head
like a piece of macula, repeating
the words of the poem

but for the sound of it
hurling soundlessly away
and then went back to singing.

the faces in the wind
gave off a slight smile,
and the ears of the dogs
gave off a little noise
when they came out to bark.

there was a hollow
in her voice as she sang.

her hands moved
with the grace and grace
of a beautiful person
and the sound of her singing
was everything
that was not.

The Fog of Settler by CAConrad

The fog of settler
draped over the cobbled streets
of a dusty village, flat as a park bench.
Deer and heifer, all blanketing,
driving in platoons. The old man
ravenous, quipping,
"If I could just get a good job."

The people, the old man,
the women, the women in their wigs
and hats, the old man
the old man and his heifer,
his rambling in a field.
They see it as impolite
to shout, "We want to go home,"
when the living are dead
and the dead are still alive.

The fog of settler/road
continued to drift
over the grassy plain
as we drove south.
We followed it on the scent
of sap, unseen,
or saw it cast
a shadow on the scattered
expresses of semis,
the mangled black sand
that burned in the engines
of forgotten cars.


If I could just get a good job.

The fog of settler
swept through a town
of single-file cab Elem Elem Elem
summer. It swarmed
like a river through a creek
as we drove past the old
mound of his former house,
where a pair of towering houses
stand empty and indifferent
on a bermudagrass-turbowed road.
The fog of settler rolled
back on us, flagging out
the houses on the other side
of a quiet creek.

The glories of settler/common
feeling grey, the glories of
the old, the old
being nothing new
are all over the place
you've never been.

Forgive me, my love, for asking it.

While you’re being gentle,

The wind’s a horse’s tail.

It’s what you’re doing.

If you knew what it’s like to be a horse,

[a series of places] by William Butler Yeats

A series of places
Have not been distinct
But have been contrived
By the mind of the earth
And the mind of man

The course is ours
We are not in a dwelling-house
Remnants of ancient
Painted palaces have survived
And are crumbling

Shining like the tattered
Leaves of old stone palaces
In view of a dark sky
Before sunset

A copper and anvil
Have been found
Individually and together
Have become a shining example
Of how there are no oil lamps

In the world, and so
A young couple
Is relaxing on a beach
As the sun sets on a gold ring

The sun is setting on a golden ring
The sun is setting on a copper
And anvil

The sun is setting on a copper
And anvil

The sun is setting on a gold ring
The moon is setting on a stone

The moon is setting on a stone
The moon is setting on a copper
And anvil

Baby by Michael Robbins

My father always encourages me
to find a square of space

between my bed and the

side of the bed, and lay

there like the sleeping

dolls I was born to be.

He said, “You
’ll be

a great baby,

you’ll make a great

baby.”

At five, my father

made me write poems

in cursive.

I was taught math

and the British School

was the safest place

for a baby.

My parents fought

all night

over the best crib.

One night my father

wrote a poem

in cursive

which was considered

good and sacred

in English but

could get lost

in German.

The next day my father

wrote a poem

in German

which my mom and dad

could’t understand.

They kept telling me

it was my fault it

didn’t speak

as it did,

it became a

massive success.

My mom and dad

were sitting there

in the dark

watching television

watching the baby.

They never understood

that poem.

The next poem

was called

“
"
Siegfried and Goetz."

My mom and dad

pushed me

so hard I

tried to break

my tooth.

They were

so upset they

called the dentist

who took my tooth.

After the tooth

they went over

again the rest

of the day.

A Habit by Pauli Murray

Who is to say what I shall be
for my next life. When I look back
at the thousand notes I scribbled
on this wall, how far will I have to go?

Will the distance exceed the time
I spent here? Will it be as long,
as long, as it takes to return
to this apartment, the diarrhea, the stench, the fear?

Will I have to walk from place to place,
from door to door, picking up
the faintest trace of my last life,

the way I did before the war?

These are the fears I must bear,
these are the petty doubts I must speak
against, in haste, with my words.

Will I be forgiven? Will I be remembered?

Only the restless heart knows.

Eating in the House by Juliet Laird

I took this picture,
two nuns in gleaming flip-flops,

kissing and taking orders in the kitchen.

One of them
was carrying out a meditation.

I did not ask
how, then,

how?

Some nuns may have
seen a man

walking in the kitchen.

Others may have
seen a woman

in the kitchen
finding eggs,

stocking the sink.

I’ve been told
that, if I had

a car, I’d drive.

I’m not sure
what to do now.

I’ll go back
to eat in the house,

eat alone,

steal eggs from the nuns.

I’ll never be
as good as I used to be.

That’s the reason I’ve only ever been

in prison. I’ve turned into a bad guy.

In a House of Shadows by Ana Božičević

In a house of shadows, the great statue
unfolding: those white wings of the moon
a bird's nest, a insect's scabbard.

In a house of shadows,
the scabbard.

But where is the bird?

On a chair beneath a table of sand.
The moon itself, in a box of toys.

Grandpa, when did you get the plane?

In the morning, in an ice cream truck.
Grandpa, what are you driving? Grandpa, what do you see?

In time, in the dead of night, after a storm
and sometimes a nap, grandma's in a wheelchair
hoisting the bloody stuff from a well.

In time, in the house of shadows,
the scabbard.

In a house of shadows,
the wheelchair, hoisting the bloody stuff.

In time, in a chair beneath a table of sand.
Grandpa, what are you driving?

In an hour, in the dead of night.
Grandpa, what are you driving?

In a night, in a house of shadows.
In a house of shadows,
the scabbard.

In a house of shadows,
the wheelchair, hoisting the bloody stuff.

In time, in the dead of night.

Grandma, the wheelchair, hoisting the bloody stuff.

In a house of shadows,
the scabbard.

Grandma's in a wheelchair.

"I love you."

Maybe she's in bed
with a book, the great statue.
Maybe she's reading.

Maybe she's in bed
with the great statue.

Grandpa, what do you think?
Maybe he's in bed
at the great statue.

In a chair beneath a table of sand.
The moon itself.
The great statue.

In a house of shadows,
the great statue.
The great statue.

“That” by Charles Hamilton Sorley

The fever dream

That you’re a man

They did such a wonderful job

In keeping me alive ten years

And today is a birthday

For my wife, and I have to tell you a story

That should make you laugh

I was a free man,

A free child,

And loved by women

Until the fever dream

That you’re a man

That is painful to my disappointment

The fever dream that you’re a man

I’m a free man,

A free child,

And loved by women like you and me

“We are still alive” by Fritz Lang

we are still alive

the last train from T​o Chiap​
chicken soup with rice

and the line attendant
said “er”

to restore order

and when we folded

the paper in half

the two long sheets
of cloth

were gone

you could see

the street light
flickering in the gap

and the windows
touched, like an old man’s

hands, and the old man

was moving away once again
and I had to hold

his hand

and we were returning

and as we pulled

to our parked cars
we bumped into

a woman
who ran up to us
with a tray

of food
and said “Ciao!”

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Eileen Myles

Quaint, yet vivid, they flash
of midwinter and the snowdrops
fall, a tangle-footed tap
of snow against a black wood.
And just out of the way,
a guitar picks up the timpani's
flint-tipped notes, and a woman
in a turquoise, top-hat
and straw hat starts to sing.

'Nights Gone by William Blake' by Mike Olden

my love is not in the gay
nightlight tonight

she is not coming

&amp; being red

&amp; up and down


&amp; down in vain

I am being sad,

I am not a boy

I am a girl

I am being gay

no it is not

I’m not gay

I’m not that

I’m not

&amp; that’s why

I’m not

I’m not

&amp; I was born

tomorrow

but

I’m not

&amp; I’m not gay

I’m not on this earth

but I have

come
to this town

My name

is on this wall

I’m in a movie

&amp; I am

being gay

I’m standing

behind the clown

and he is

a clown

I am

famous

and he is

fame

being famous

gets me

all over

the country
and the world

until

my name

has come

from

the circus
the alley

which one

are you

I don’t know

but

I’m there

I am

at my station

I am

in a movie

Birthday by Naomi Shihab Nye

As I push the mixtape case open, bicycle one hour down the path
of the house where I'm born
to a house that was abandoned

I get to the house on the third floor
and I'm in there

I'm in there with that little baby,
there

It's just a matter of choosing
not to go down

the door



The house is under a sky
that's been blown on a truck

I get to the porch



We're all in the backyard
where the candles flicker

Our first memory is
my mother’s eyes

and all the gifts
that she gave me

it doesn't matter
he was my favorite

I didn’t know
what  I was saying
about myself

I can’t be great
I can’t be big
I can’t be

I do what I want

but I know
that I am going to go down

I’m going to go down
like a bad man
like the one in the movie

I know
that I am going to
be the man in the movie

he’s just
a guy with
big-tipped boots
and curly-haired hair

the one with
big brown feet
and big brown eyes
but who has
big brown feet
and big brown eyes

and curly-haired
and curly-haired

body and
curly-haired

all beautiful
and curly-haired

and curly-haired
and curly-haired
and curly-haired

the one in the movie
is the same
,

his
feet
are flat and
too big
to walk
and he’s
also

too white
to walk
and he
is
also
too big
to walk

I know
it’s
just

a matter of choosing
it’s
not a matter
of
choosing
it’s
a matter for

sheets
and curtains
and
dresses
and
curtains.

There’s
no
luck
with it.

The Walking Stairs by Louise Erdrich

After the labor party and its numbers were settled, the children, the old, the poor, the injured,
and the hopeless

the dead, the dying, and the wandering, they marched on
up the stairs,

and down again,
to the top of the stairs,

to the bottom:

the shoe, the bouquet, the dirty dog

they were carrying,

the belt of bones
that held the cat in the catsuit

they were carrying,
he sat on the steps, a coat

of fur,

the cage of bones
they had buried him in,

the random things they had brought
to town

as they walked,
"good luck"

in the middle of town

was a standing ovation
for the kids

and the walking stairs
for the dead and the walking stairs
for the dead

The Afternoon by John Keats

I’ve scarcely touched the shore,
But I feel the tide go out, and, in the distance,
Half-understand,
I see the big Alger dune-bed,
And half-understand, the wave
Go ploughing by,
And all the great trees around
Hoist themselves,
Scattering their leaves
Into the yards.

All over the valley
There’s a shoe-string lagoon
Where the tide’s gone,
And there’s the sound of a million boats,
And the great Balkan canoe,
Jefferson’s canoe,
And the great octopus,
And the big car,
And the big canoe,
And the dolphins,
And the great camel,
And the great horse
And the great cattle,
And the great mirror,
And the great horse’s reins,
And the great mirror’s
Cream-painted nose,
And the great car’s wind-pounded wheels,
And the great mirror’s
Shiny face,
And the great Alger dune’bed’s
Big Leotard,
And all these great boats,
And all these great lads
Who flew under the boat,
And all the great tents
And all the great lanterns
Where you are standing,
And all these great lads
Who perished in the larder,
And all these great men,
And all this great tram,
And all these great mirrors,
All these great tarpaulins,
And all this great larder,
And all these great lads
Who died in the larder,
And all these great shacks
And all these great tent poles
Where you are sitting,
And all these great larders,
And all these great cragshacks,
And all these great tarpaulins,
All these great bicycles,
And all these great vehicles,
And all these great loud thumps,
And all these great chairs,
And all these great great beds,
And all these great wall-paintings
Where you are lying down,
And all these great mountains, and all these great plains,
And all these great great beaches,
And all these great great beaches whose names
You carry with you,
And all these great big boats,
And all these great big tires,
And all these great big ladders,
And all these great little boats,
And all these great little bicycles,
And all these great little boats,
And all these great little beaches,
And all these great big larders,
And all these great big tires,
And all these great big poles,
And all these great little boats,
And all these great little beaches,
And all these great big tarpaulins,
And all these great little bicycles,
And all these great little bikes,
And all these great little boats
And all these great big larders,
And all these great little boats,
And all these great little beach,
And all this great great big chair
And all the great big beaches,
And all these great big chairs and all these great big larders
And all these great big bicycles,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big beachcabs,
And all these great big tires,
And all these great big tarpaulins,
And all these great big chairs,
And all these great little boats,
And all these great big sandals,
And all these great big chairs,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big books,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big bicycles,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big tarpaulins,
And all these great big bicycles,
And all these great big books,
And all these great big sandals,
And all these great big bicycles,

And all these great big chairs,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big seas,
And all these great big chairs,
And all these great big books,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big
Big wheels on all these great big bicycles,
And all these great big beaches,
And all these great big
Cacks of miscellaneous rubbish on all these great big beaches
Are, in the end, the sound of the sea.

Orkest Monastery by Eileen Myles

The achen poles come down to the floor.
The monks sit in a circle and chat.
Each monosyllable is an achen pole,
a silhouette of a monk's face.
The monk sits in a circle and chats.
The monks sit in a circle and chat.
There are outcasts, and there are monks
who only pray to the monks.
This metaphor is not nearly as clever
or dramatic as I would have liked.
The monks sit in a circle and chat.
The monks sit in a circle and chat.
There are outcasts, and there are monks
who only pray to the monks.

In hopes that it will act as a metaphor,
a specific monosyllable is made.
A silhouette of a monk's face
is recast as an achen pole.

   Judgment by William Butler Yeats

Judgment is like a house divided,
And the ground, it is said, is worthless;
Judgment is a false roof,
A roof upon the field,
A house upon the yard,
A house upon the wall,
A roof upon the hall.

Judgment is like a chimney
Winding to a halt
Upon the hearth, the floor,
The door of a house
Wringing on its keep.
Judgment is like a thumping

Till the earth finds its fame,
Like mobs of the deaf,
Like issails of the blind,
Like the groans of the drowning,
Like the roaring cocks of the ship:
Judgment is like the most awful screech
Of the dog that ate the crib.
Judgment is like a judge
Whose gavel is aimed at one thing
And has no time to spare.
Judgment is like the head of the snake,

Who will not obey the hand
That is his masterful head,
Like a knuckle, as the knuckle-bones,
Like the head of the snake,
Like the rattle of the tortoise
And the roar of the tortoise's shell.
Judgment is like the quarrels of a child
With an elder brother,
Like the unhappy marriage of a man and his sister,
Like the great courtroom of a city with no other purpose.

Judgment is like an abacus
Of the greatest mysteries,
The greatest mysteries of man;
Courts are a map of the land,
And in them the compass of the land is found,
The harbor of the land is called "Lakenheit,"
The harbor of the land is called "Lakenheit,"
The harbor of the land is called "Lakenheit."

Mourning by Andy Weir

And who will clean the grave for me? No one,
and I implore you to leave us not. I shall
[climb] the stairs that lead into the house
and open the door, and kneel before the front door
and say, “It’s been raining here,” and weep.
I’ll make a bed and I will make myself
[bless]—I will cry and I will be a good girl
[out there on the highway] and I will not take you back,
[and I will not live at any expense] if
you stay.

A Little Closer to the Edge by D. Nurkse

Before I was a tree, before I was a stranger
I was a little closer to the edge.

My father had spent his life on the edge,
and he walked long to the edge,
to the edge of the house.

He came back, new-cut, he came back
without a shadow of a doubt,
to the same place, on the same day.

He sat on the porch step, and he
made a little speech for him,
for him, he was one of us.

Little closer to the edge,
little closer to the edge,

he’d always said, I’ll be back.

''There’s a rockabilly band working at my dad” by Wilmer Mills

There’s a rockabilly band working at my dad —
up a little hill,
up a mudhill,
waddling up to a chicken shack,
smoking a joint,
singing a little song,
all in the face of the sun

Why Shouldn’t We Eat Together by John Donne

Why shouldn’t we have the wits and the gaiety of a matchbox
open on the roadside and somewhere in the twilight

whenever the sun, the cities, the simple desire
of the world, bursts open to light

in a big panoply of colors and noises and laughter
in a way that is not the present

and is not the future and is not the past

and is not the present but is the future

that is the shadow that hangs over all

and all the light that rolls into the

blackness of our lives

How long before you die by Lucretius

How long before you die
As a child?
How long before you?

And how will you
Know when
You have

Of what

Year?

How long before you

Die?

And how long,

In what,

And what?

And you,

How long?

And you too,

How long.

Abe-Sing-Sing by Robin Ekiss

He’s getting older and the color of his hair
is full of bitterness, but he’s a good liar. He’ll tell you
all about how he was a bad kid, how he got into trouble

because he’s a good liar, that he’s doing his best to be
a good one, how he’s sorry, that his Dad

loves him.

He’s getting older and the color of his hair
is beautiful and it’s only the outside world we worry about.

But we’re not allowed to wear nice jewelry, we need
a scar to prove it, we can’t

walk down our own streets, our own streets are
all over the map, we’re not allowed to have any friends

whose parents are really nice, our friends
are all fugitives, clacking guns, or just plain old

good ol  boys.

Poems &amp; Their Discussations by Norman Williams

It’s raining

today, and you’re

here with me

so why don’t we

hang out somewhere

(as if)

we could talk

about the weather and

cookies and the

lots of it

and just

deal with it

like individuals

at a bar

talking about business

&amp; how

everyone takes

a cut

of every paycheck

&amp; it’s

arranged in

the best

way and no

shit whatsoever

Snakes, Toads and Vipers by Cecilia Vicuña

This is what happens when you drink too much tequila
or dark chocolate. It's the Mexican Santa Clarita
coming to town last night to do her favz…

I got home, my cup was half full of whiskey
and hot cocoa, it was a shame to leave
like I did. I had my jacket on and my socks on
and a pair of skinny blue jeans. I tried to walk

a mile with a skeleton in my shoes
but I couldn't move my feet at all,
I was so hot and sticky and sleepy

and just plain old boring
I was thinking the time I left
was going to be just like the time I arrived

I had this alien idea
of making a mountain out of nothing
but the beautiful thing

I'm back, and I'm going to be
excited to hear the story of my life

and your story, friend.

====================
