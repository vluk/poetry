Room by Thomas Merton

Once: A voice
with a voice with a voice,
Ah, three nights, ah, in a inn.
Three nights, ah, in a inn

The good cats all asleep in the bed
that is not a bed and that is
a hollow, a place of nothing.
A voice
that is a scream that is not a scream.

The stars of heaven are not the stars
of heaven, but the stars of heaven

The poor are poor, and the rich are rich,
Ah, three nights, ah, in a inn.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Leonard E. Nathan

He woke up late,
the dress was in the closet,
he was in his room
but he was dreaming
the honest truth,
the truth that does not
belong to him.

Something was wrong,
but he could not tell
what. The night was too cold,
the door was ajar,
and the sheets,
his room has an attic
on it,
a new bed and
the couch,
his room has an attic
a new dresser
and the pictures,
his room has an attic

the honest truth.
He woke up late,
the dress was in the closet,
he was in his room,
but he was dreaming.

Old Forecast by Leslie Harrison

In the new forecast,
in January, the wheat will
be gone by March,
shall move north, once

a year, long enough
to stay in Kansas City
a bit longer, to rustle

from the dark pastures
of  a month, two
if I count my bucks,
in between riding horses,

kept in mind
the rain coming down
and that I was
at home, my little

foyers, my trunks,
those kayaks and rafts
that my grandmother

stored in her trailer
so she could take me

back to Utah where
the ocean keeps
coiling like a burr
and there is only the sound
of the rain

cleaning the driveway,
feeling for the keys,
recovering, getting ready
to walk into my own

gown, to my own braids,
recovering, getting
ready again

to survey the dream
I’ve just come
and sweep the powder
out of-doors

into the car’s sun.

Lining Up to Buy a Car by William Butler Yeats

Standing at the door,
Walking the street,
I will give my life
To a car,
Old, dark, slow,
Cheap, lusty, and white.

I am the wind
That blows the changing light,
That lays the new,
The new, the old,
Untangled all
From the old.

I am the rain
That moves in the water,
That makes it rain,
The rain,
Rain, little,
Little, fall,
Down, at the heel,
To fill your boots,
Your shoes,
Fits for a young farmer
That has come to our town,
Entry lucky,
Opened doors and windows
For a few who have come in
To be a young farmer,
Some to get out to drive a wagon,
Some to take a wagon to the mart.

I am the light
That moves you
Between the sidewalks
That can’t hold your shoes,
Etc.

I am the quiet, little house
That sits at the crossroads,
Where you sit at the piano,
And it sits on a stand
So that you can hear your own
Little voice,
A little voice,
Dancing slowly
Across the stage.

[A statue of a little fish (leg)] by Lex Gauthier

A statue of a little fish (leg)

of unknown meaning

brought to light


the quarry of my life and my career

that was the forgotten face

at my bed,

that was the year from under my

bottomed

leather tie, that cross

I never even noticed at first

that one’s my army of fish

I’ll show you

that fish are a man’s body

and that fish are the face

of my year

it’s clear who owns

the one thing I’ve made

of all of my years

where am I today,

where did I go,

where do I have to go?

He sits there, his arms

on the table,

and smiles.

Chapter XV. Death by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

It could never be true.
The world was droning, and all the gods but one
were dead. Our Mars went down
in a thunderstorm; was he in danger?

The Lote-Tree, as it were,

was not so much a Tree
lacked in teeth as a hideous

Unknown
.

At last, a welcome home,
a tomb for an unknown
that was, in the end,

Alive.

In this book of dark,
there’s a book that cannot be
destroyed,

the book of the

Book of   Death.

I'll Hang Fish by Lisa Wells

The dark is not your house.
Night sun is your pillow.

A candle is a window.
A cactus is a boot.

Water will boil in a pot.
Sun will spin in a straw.

People are a mouselike machine.
They mount you on its wheels.
They thump you seductively.

Your love is the rudder of some spacecraft.
Your hate is the cottage of an Elder Tale.

Wear these clothes and have friends.
Stay in touch.
You'll be fine.

The Snail:
  
  
   20. The snail comes from the sea by John Haines

The snail comes from the sea
and has come from the sea
to earth, and has come
to earth to the earth,
and has come
to earth to the earth.

And the day which is not
sunburnt in the sky,
the gilt moon, that is
fountaining rain, the glow
of the moon or the quiet
earth in a cage,
it is the snail's
task to show us
the snail's task
is to stay
with the chains
that we are tying to it
while it changes shape.

And how will this work?
I have no idea.
And how will it come to pass?
I’m afraid and satisfied
and don’t care if it’s true,
though it’s a relief
to know that the snail
comes from the sea
though it’s not true.

The Tarot by Robert W. Service

God is not on a plane
or a horse in a barn, he’s hiding.
They’re both twenty-four hours in a bar
doing the same thing.

I’m wearing my best coat
and hat, and my camera,
I can see myself in the mirror,
the van outside the bar
hangs a hundred to a hundred
guests, and I’m eating pizza
I can hear myself
singing while waiting

for the show to start,
and you could sit here and listen
just as I sat here too
three or four years ago
and I would have been happy to,
admiring the way my face
kind of looked like someone
in a Japanese movie

I’ve never seen
(I’m also wearing
my best tie,
and I don’t want to look like a joke
I’m not interested in,
glad my face is so fake
I can’t get up off the floor
to do it without my coat
on, or the rain
and the stars blocking it
is over)

And if it is,
it’s still a nice place to stay,
and it’s not the worst place
to stay.

Still, I can’t get my head around
the fact that there is
no God and he’s not
on a plane.

The Fates by Beum Earp

One of the greatest metamorphoses ever committed
While in the Hellfire Club, the last pack of fire-thimbles
They’re coming off the shelf

(The Negroe)

Un-comfortable, and fierce, as I’ll get
Can’t be contented for that

Never again to have to carry the weight of her,

My self-esteem, once in a lifetime to be lost,

She was the greatest witness I could find

(Behind the Black and the Brown)

From the depths of my soul
The swift sea tumbles slowly out

And I pick up my things

With my feet

I am still here and back

Still in my old wrinkles, which don’t crumble
I can sleep when dark

In my dreams, I'm on a train

Going down

(To the cemetery)

Down    steep     ravine    hard       wall    plate    ice

Courts    torn        steel    rocky    rock    cliff    beach    me   

It’s not    zing    I

Quarts by Fady Joudah

At last we could do it
in the house we were squatting on next to
the city limits — love — at the dawn
of July. With a servant
in a tapestry of clerical shirts
and trousers, a maid in a straw hat,

I had said goodbye to my brother and
 I was lost in the night the sky
was that of a school bus
all that I had said I was going to do
for a long time.

As the day got brighter
I was feeling good with the way my life
was going. I was hanging out
with your friends and all of a sudden
you showed up in the distance revealing
a little boy missing a leg, you had
just sprawled on the carpet with your back
against a wall the maid
had lifted for him. Frown
and half-wring, she had lifted
his shirt as if he were some kind of loose
pole for her to lean against.

The Way Home by Joshua Beckman

Nowhere to hide.
As the black blaze of autumn
folds like a large sheet of forest
around the oak,
what was once a forest
is now a vast expanse of home
where everything is decaying
and the stones are molded.

The only thing I know
is that everything is falling
on the path toward it
the path toward what
I call "home."

In the distance
a bluff of water
asif by Anecdote Encapsulates
the place where we are reborn,
where everything we do is meaningless
and the place where we meet every day
is true.
It’s a place we haven’t quite
really been to.

This is the way home,
home that’s not
just a house
but a solitary city in a world
where the ideal
of both the past and the future
is not to be found in each other
but, as always, in the long field
of emptiness.

Sonnet 19:  Lord, I’m leaving this life by William Shakespeare

Lord, I’m leaving this life
And all this sorrow, this pain, this strife
Will be with you forever. I’m leaving
My life you made for me, for your son.
My life was made to be your son.
You said given talent descends
And talent is the best inheritance.
Thankfully, you know how to get talent.
You quietly taught me those secrets.
On this sad day I feel your wide embrace.
I would be dead to leave this life,
But I am certain you will be always.
Arise then and let me—"

The world would be a better place, if only
I could turn back, and so could you.

Your grandchildren are great people
And I am sure I could not live any longer
If only I could turn back to one of you.
But if I could turn back to you
I’d be living in the day of my own,
Which is not the greatest day.
Now then let me leave today,
Not dead but alive.

every knife the same,

although the women’s room has changed
to a kitchen, their money has

not changed, nor have
the foodstuffs

that are not potatoes,

that are not sweet potatoes,

that are not carrots
that are not carrots,

that are not even referring to
volatile vegetables

The Duchess of Malfi Purged by Sir  Thomas Wyatt

I. Purged and Separated

The Duchess of Malfi was as vicious a woman as there be.
Pierce’d her like the best end of an Ironmonger’s flail;
Even after she had been for the best of her life;
An Axe with that very sharpness smashed into her face.
The fact is, that she was a brute,
All that she had to do it with that viciousness.
She kept a vicious mistress, and Saul’d as well;
For, on From Time and Everlasting Night,
By her ancient disgrace, she loved Saul’d thought.

looking for old coal

I pluck them

O! lest I
Hath a mind
In such a rage
Must I

Wobble

Must I

Be a tragedy

Falling fast
As the ship

Be sinking
Either way it’s good
To die

In a hole
Where are you now
The man who’s got
A hair
To shave

Tightening the sails
And the waters
Are turning

When they take off

Take off
And you
Divide into two

Is it true
You are more
That way than I

Am I more the way it?

“The momo” by Maciej Bodnar

The momo – an armadillo – is a slender, largely unknown animal
was probably brought here from the lowlands of western Mexico
by pioneers

the first arms

may have been men

the first arms were the shape of a woman
the head was not

a single leg

it is sometimes mistaken for a small flat horse
the legs of the armadillo are

similar in length

but what distinguishes the armadillo from a horse is its

piercy green hide

it is stabbed on the ground in a fashion

that is painful – it has been said
that the armadillo is

slow and graceful

that it likes to be held up

by the foot or cannibal ....

sometimes it is more like a rabbit

that crawls on a patch of ground

but it is not shy
and it will not grow

it is what it is -

a pig that is hoisted

on a cart

that is headed south

that is a future for bones

a future that is psychic

and the reason the armadillo is

scarcely feral in the woods of western Mexico is because it

needed to be fed

and it is there that the next plains march

that is the "precinct of things"

that is sacred

and that is why the next Plains march stretches

into the distance

that is always previous to the mountains of western Mexico

that are always future

and the next prairie march

that is the blueprint for the spinal
and the long awaited last leg of the great plains

that we are told will be long and long in the future

Why Is My Hair Falling Off? by W. S. Merwin

Amenities are a bit easier. If the wind blows, I start with my thinking,
and give up the idea of space, and start with my head.

If the wind blows, I start with my leaving hands
behind me, and cling to the ground, poised to leap,

in the tall grasses. If the wind blows, I hold my breath,
but not quite there yet, so I look around, and look back,

in the open view of a great field outside of Salerno.

Where is the hill that rose here from the sea of weeds?
It is the last thing I should have done, a trifle unwise.

I am waiting for the horse to get out of the way, for the snow
to melt in him, and the field to scatter in the wind and become a field of hay.

I am waiting for the summer to melt in me, and the sun to die.
I am waiting for the last thing to happen in the world: the wind,
the hay, the sun, the horse.

Deeds of Love by Randall Mann

I.

Know thy pain.
Do not flinch.
Hear, oh hear, the roar of the trampling step
of the weary feet
which the dog-king mounts
to his gray palace of the strong
on a sound stage
to win the affections
of the dancing feet and the ragged clothes
of the solitary weary feet
who have sweated there and gone there
and who have hated their miserable shoes
and gone away
and been moved to search for new shoes with some truth
now that the soles of their feet
have been worn down and worn down
to the shoes of the walking feet
which have been worn down to the foot-high grass-
graved with shitty hooves and muck
so earth-bound the shoes of the walking feet
shall have to be worn while the front door of the palace of the strong
castle-like so that the guards shall shout
and the door shall be slammed
and the little girls who have been beaten
and have been beaten
and will have to be beaten
by the men who beat the little girls and have an interest in beating them
with their own battered feet and battered faces
shall be gentle and gentle and gentle
on the horse the dolphins shall be gentle and gentle
and some day the dogs shall be gentle and gentle
all the time we are all in our painful places
and we need each other
I.
Know thy pain.

You ought to learn to sing love songs.
You ought to run into a wall
And drown. You ought to get drunk
And faint. You ought to get dirty
And get raped. You ought to loot.
You ought to stay home and cry.
You ought to get a job at a lumber yard.
You ought to be poor and poor.
You ought to stay at home and cry.
You ought to get married and die.
You ought to be poor and poor.

Sealed in Sails by Robin Ekiss

There are always a few flickering headlights
we see in the distance, two or three
beneath the darkening sky, they give

a small improvement; a fleeting sense
of security; a politician saying

a long time ago
it’s called the seabedding fleet

showing up next to us

it is.

And it’s not a distant fleet
nor an empty vessel falling back

from the night with a single pilot
nor a single anchor, it’s

a ship, an entire ship,

a fleet, a polished, crystalline vessel
and we love ships.

Our lives’ll be held together by
the seabedding fleet

a wingspan of sixty miles, a ten
nautical miles, even the elusive

Atlantic. Even the elusive
Margaret,

the sea. The seabedding fleet

merges with the seabied fleet
and the seabedding fleet loses

its Atlantic.
The seabedding fleet

floats, speedboats so slow
that one could not keep
their legs on board,

and the merchant ship,
its steamer, its keel,

admits to bury its face
in the seabedding sail
that is relentlessly
commitant but reckless

in the face of that straightforward cold
in the ocean.

And it is our fate
to look together

where we stand
in this universe

being bound to each other
by the seabedding fleet

that chooses this life
and that small village,
its many weatherbeaten houses,

its few hulked bottles
of beer,
its elegant carriages,

its well-trimmed feet,
these are actually at the centre
of all our lives.

your breath alighting
on your nerves,
your cello and your

lips. In the middle
of the night,

you wake up the pale
lip of your girl

looking for a great big

babe, a narrator

you’ll never forget.

Double-decker buses
have done all the work

and time is another star

to take you home.

Touch me, I’ll give you

a ride, a calm

gentle wail,

a whisper of a seat

and the sound

of a door

clacking open,

and the sound

of a door

and a lift—

I’m always going to

call you back.

She’ll write the great speech, and we’ll go back

That’s how it will always be. I am not prepared

The Story of Rachel
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Sadiqa Lipsky

We’re not the only ones with stories. We shuffle
ourself about in the dark like between two
scapes, a poet and his sleeping book,
the song with its keys picked up
by a hand or an ear,
a wall
print on paper,


language
for the dead,
where was he
before he came back.

Who was her
and what was her
and what was his
name, and what was her
and what was her
and what was his
name. .

The song with its keys picked up
by a hand or an ear
opens a story that is old,
and will surely be
old until we die,
but many years

within its lines. That story
is not ours. That song
is not his, nor is his.
Not by me. .
Not by Rachel.
And neither is the story,
but that music, that line,
and the story—

resonant and entrancing
as the song,
resonant
and entrancing
as the words,
and the waking—
that it rings true.

from the rich and terrible

a whip of light
a brighter day
we need a lot

Amber by A. F. Moritz

I was singing in the dark,
like a bride,
at the ball.

My mother was in the room
and I was in the dark.

I was in a corner
above the stage
till my father came,
in the dark.

He was dressed in black
and he said,You couldn’t come in
to the sound.

I was in the dark.

I was singing in the dark.

I was singing in the dark

Rectangle with Poppy Trees by Rodney Torreson

They’re all here: the crooked
ruts, the pockmarked
arthrons, the flattened-
up sides of the houses
that used to be their
place, and the old
bohemian bungalows or
chipped-off boats.

The miles of roads
that once ran parallel
to the river’s gorge
here where I’m standing
on a mint-
smelling cross; I’m
just about to step
into a little hole in the
river where I’d be
a long, long
single file if I could walk.

Ceremonies at the Harry’s by Dr. Peter Gizzi

A similar number of people
Couldn’t mind the smell of cooking,
Couldn’t care less about the misery in Springfield

and the bunch of orphans,
Couldn’t sleep until the lights
Of a hotel appeared in the distance

till the shadows of trees
Moved in the dark.

The lady in the purple
Claymore asked if she’ll be held,
The lady in the charcoal gray
Claymore asked if she’ll be held.

And I guess that night
The tall old lady
Led up to the bed
And just as I was about to say

“Shoot, you’re here;”
So I was, I just pulled me out
Of my chair,

Anyhow, I don’t care,
His mouth was a living stove,
His eyes the priest on the floor,

He led me up and the bedraggled lady
Approached the man in the dark
And carried him into the woods,

To the sound of voices
Jettisoning the body
Of a deceased man.

“SHoot, you’re here,”
I said, “O. K.,”

“Why don’t we just pay our bills.”

“Beyond the Boundary by Daniel J. Langton

On the highway, a tree
swings across a paned glass:

the window into a wind room.

The twisting road turns again
to find itself again—

the tree again
consumed this sweet savoir:

a broken trail,

a burnt-off hand
wrestle in fender brambles.

I'd like to kiss the stars
plain and not by moonlight.

The tree untangled itself
from the road like a hangnail:

and the trees did the rest.

From the porch, I would choose again
the perfect afternoon, sun
attending to nothing below

but the rain,

and being rewarded
when its yearly gathering

dies on a wire box.

The Dream in a Dream by Zoran Zopic

Here and there, on a queue
I’m the hot luck—
I’m not

the luckiest. In the end,

a hedge flicks on a tree;
I wake up at the foot
of a pond

and hear a rustling close
by the way

of a cat.

I’m not what you think,

except that I was born

in the United States
and have lived my entire life

in a dream
about a woman—

a woman
who sings among the trees.

I’m supposed to be a hero,

but who knows more about trees
of war and peace

than I do.

To the Virgin by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

A woman *must* be virtuous.
No one is ever punished.
Beneath the leather covers on our knees
we stand, nude,
in a field of leeks. Up the hill,
there’s a handsome little church
with an enormous spire —
the roof over our heads,

the field’s the ground —
the meadow, the bay,
the wind’s knocking at the door.
But I have been to a real man
who is in the house listening.
He’s in his nightgown
talking to someone who’s in the kitchen
baking pancakes and pouring

mixed drinks. He’s talking about
the past and the future.
He’s in the kitchen
baking pancakes and pouring

mixed drinks. That’s the virgin.

An Act to Raise the Metropolis by Robert Herrick

This petition has had the force of 13,092 petitions:
The first ground-rental rent hath been
Sell to me.
I go to the hell of ancients —
They did me wrong.
How many people need a shock in unison,
And across the seas to fight a phantom?

Take these 7,259,470 souls (there are no excuses)
And quench the deep.
O fool, long-lived as a Ben Jonson,
Made famous for his wisdom,
With that mouth of his,
Unspoke with so much malice.
“Who are you?” asks the rain.
It is, again, not disillusioned,
It is dead set on exalting himself,
On exalting himself.
The Capacities of a felt glove.
The rotten facade of his beloved city:
The only real civilization in the land.
A birdhouse outfitted to his comings and goings —
A spire, and a parlor called home.
My heart’s ears with a happy flap —
A bird shelter in a wren’s nest.

“Feirdeau” by Maxine Kumin

My favorite haunts in the belly,
a distaste for the handshake,
competently crushing the ichthyic crusts
behind my fist. Push me again
or I'll roll off a cliff — I’m often glad
to have been born in Texas.

The fathers who took me
from my parents and raised me
in a good home are long gone,
golden boys who lovingly fed

the roses in their garden
and the good books of their children.
They’ve worn "allowed" T-shirts
And signed the autographs
I shouldn’t have like lyrics on my car

I kid you not.
I know my temper has outgrown
the other two.

I’ve done my best to be polite,
smile or slap someone
if it’s necessary —
There’s a privilege to be born

in a very poor area.
I’ve learned to be decent to each person
like the poor children under my care.

The future is bright,
all of the outside phylum
has already been deleted.

The great ocean, singing Song
is the greatest song,
and I’m singing.

Thank you, Mary,
the great ocean,
the great ocean’s song
is the greatest song.

The great ocean, singing Song, is the greatest song.

Song: “Allahu akbar” by Anonymous

Allahu akbar”

(“Akbar” is a Short Prayer.)

There are many books
and people, great and small,
who the most important thing is
(to remind us who we are).

The most important thing is
to remember that the most important thing
is love.

Love is so important
not because it is easy
(because it’s not),
but because it’s our
#1 job to love ourselves,
and we do
.
Love is so important
because love means love,
and love means Love,

and love means Love.

Appetite by Ayrton Senna

You’re only hungry
when the food is plentiful,
not hungry when the food is
forgotten. Hunger
is the desire to be satisfied
by any means necessary.

I think of young women
who’ve survived hunger
by not starving. I think of
snowfields with the smell
of horse reindeer and
a fox guarding a mass
of trout, a flock of dirty
awful prairie dogs from
the heat of the sun, the smell
of human misery
every time it’s on the air.

I think of the strangers
I met when I was
an ichthyological outsider,
the beadless and jaunty
askance and panache
of people I didn’t know,
the ludicrous innocence,
all that hair and
all that money and
the bombs going off
in the buildings where
I worked.

Chamois by Louise Erdrich

Remembered by the carnivals, the hev’n folk,
Washes up in the well.
Forgotten by the rest of us in the nip
and tuck and retrograde field,

It was always the chamois that knew
Silly talk about Irish joblessness
Even though the other kids knew
The chamois was always talking about
Irish joblessness, Irish unemployment.

And now I am here in this Kauai sunset
And I can’t see anything but the chamois
Or I will be soon deported to Ireland.


Cattle-talk was always including the chamois,
And that’s why it is remembered today,
Not only as a cool thing to say,
But also as a thing we like to say.

This Is My Life by Patricia Brodzik

Tourists always have dreams.
I’ve had all my dreams.
I’ve had only one.
Every time I look at my watch
it’s almost two hours late.
I’ve had two,
and this time, I’ll be home early.

I’ve had my freedom and I’ve had my time.
I’ve had my freedom a lot
and this time, I’ll be home early.

There’s how sweet it is
to be a house.
There’s how sweet
it is to be a house.

There’s good food and there’s bad food.
There’s a certain air
you breathe when you’re at home.
There’s a certain color
you’re in.

There’s a certain shape
you’re in,
and a certain length
you’re in.
There’s a certain angle
you’re in,
there’s a certain shape
you’re in.
There’s
a certain air
you’re in.
There’s what
you’re in.
There’s good food and there’s bad food.

Every time I look at my watch
it’s almost two hours late.

My heart races.
I’m reminded of Andrew and his family.
The Hangover is as good as it gets.
It’s as good as it gets.
Forget: the squeezeful of a bubble gum drink.
The jeers of the kids.
Raucous laughter.

The School And The Ringby William Butler Yeats

Since we hang our heads,
And sham our stands,
And sham our rows,

And sham our bells,
And sham our swords,
We shall not hear
The school bell ring,

The school and the ring,
The teacher and the rings,
The bell and the ring,

The bells and the rings and the teacher,
The bell and rings and the teachers,
The bells and bells and the bells and the rings and the rings and the teachers.

Sleepers by Marge Piercy

Awake, and this sweet hum of silence fills me.
In the frail green night in a phoenix’s glass
I look, I stare, I wait for the perfect
touch of a woman’s arm. The breath’s like the breath
of a calm, lilac, moon and a petal
that once were two, and that my mother
sweeps her hands over and over again
like a casket with a sound-snatched needle.
Plunging to your body, in the dark, open
to whatever you have to put there,
you are still wrapped up in your own skin,
circling and fading, and, walking,
you may hear yourself saying,
“Oh, you’re so beautiful.”

One Day by Ted Berrigan

Ask no questions and all will be done.
Ask no more and the world stays the same.
Ask and no more and everything is done—

Only the shadow of him will remain.

The world will be nothing but the empty shades
of tomorrow, the major and minor announcement,
the quiet words of the great ones,

and the other little buggers.

“What is dead is dead” by Yi Cai

What is dead is dead
Is dead for its own sake.

It is a dead man's shoes
Or a dead woman's shoe,

It is a dead pin,
Strapped to an old chair,

It is a dead book,
Written by a dead author,

Not dead.
Dead*

The Seeker's Dalliance by Charley Cassarino

The seeker's delight; the fire-lit circle of water; the olive tree
could be a body of work, a new book of ceaseless art. . . .

Something once said
is a blast of air or the entrance into a burning wound.
It is the seer's body moved by the will
to make love, the seer's old self reappearing

in a new flesh.
The line of the mouth’s where the sentence is said,
the rotting world’s blind ripe fruit;

I knew from your posture,
that it was not my place to praise or scorn.

I could have said the penance that I had known,
was not for me, but whose praise is theirs to give.

“And the Joered” by Sir  Thomas Wyatt

And the Joered, who
Doth sound the sad tale,
Doth shine the light that shineeth;
The Lord comes in his chariot,
And with a straight face,
And with a good face,
Straight as the sun,
With a heart like lightning,
Hath he first hewed
To the field of his praise,
And then journeyeth
Upon the fairs of the field,
With slow pace,
With a walk of the blind,
With a scornful push,
Till, as he hath done,
He hath set his whole face round
The holy place,
And with a broad sweep
Hind his brow,
And with a grin,
And a look of scorn,
He hirself hath broken
The day of his holy name.

Let us leave him
To his fate;
Whilst we grieve,
We wish him pardon,
And flush the sin,
Until he may rise;
Then, with speechless scorn,
With a yell,
With a tir'n,
With a sing of laughter,
He doth right and well,
The enemy doth strike him.
Until his vind or sill is done,
Why shall we not enjoy
His honour and his right,
And his shame,
And his shame again?

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Gail Mazur

I am the one who lays out the funeral
for the one I love, the one I don’t love,
who shows up late to work, lifts
all the food and drinks out
and never once does it matter.
I am the one who says
“Hey Siri,” but which one of us
will start a car? Who will drive
the one I miss the most?
I am the one who waits
for the one who is always
not here, the one who looks
like the ghost in the mirror.
The one who has a
perfect life, who is
the luckiest woman in the world.

Remorse by André Borman

I have not left
my petty existence
in shame. I
was not born
without my clothes on.
Because for me
the most painful part
of my life has
been emptiness.

A desolate house
I walked down
for days without
my coat
and when I
was finally
at my door
I was
muted.

A bandage
of my nose
was a running
place for the fear
of being alone.

I am still
at this message
from the Gadarenes
I throw to
the sidewalk’s
blackness and
a loophole
in the wall

among some
occasionless
curtains of stars
surfacing

in the clouds
I guess
I was
brave,
exactly
what I
hadn’t planned

embarrassed
at my
outlandish
porridge.

Need to be reminded of

Who used to snap the F.B.I.
All over the place
Those days I

As gentle as yesterday
I can still be
A reverend and a good Christian
For you.

The Lost Letter by Robert W. Service

In case you were sleeping on the edge
of the sea, I guess I will always be here.
Before the wind slides into the moorings
and breaks
the ship's door
I will still be wearing my best clothes.

The wind is watching to see how I do.
If I don’t take off my shoe
it will be past midnight,
one hour late for work,
though I know my clothes
are still on.

The wind will become the moon
when it’s still too heavy to carry,
and I will be well-rested
if I’ve already passed.

I will stay inside as long as I can.
When the last clock is rung
I will open the door
while the other clock is still running,
and I will be right there
in my bed that smells of fish.

The Elegant Municipalities of the Great Lakes by Margarita Engle

In thick silence
the man at the register
gave me a card for the permit
for a weeklong renovation project
but what I really wanted
was a free phone line
that would go straight to my house
with no middleman
like the old one in Union Station
but, oh, how I wished
it was not for the lack of a place to live
with my ashes on top
or for my being a ghost!

My mother was the gentle one
who would not say too much
but never drive alone
or stay in too many places
(the truth is she had
a very tight heart)
since she was always facing
toward a bright future
where she could grow up

and, if she still lived
in beautiful places,
where angels came even
if they were not in power
like the ones on this list
I would still want
a free, erect, beautiful home
to live in

for my kids

The Lonely Sea by Jorge Luis Borges

The mind has no chance of grasping the truth,
Is in a world of its own making,

A world of a world, endless
Leaden dark dark and keener than the rest;

Where the solid sand, the green bed, and the earth stand still,

Are nothing more than a swarm of the chaotic

Crane of a numberless flying bolsters,

Whose clanging, shivering wings of desolation

Dance in the sky like the mistress of the house

Dancing and dancing in a labyrinth of the mind.

If you have time for yourself

You will join with others

And go to sea, to the Lonely Sea,

Ploughing in the empty dust,

This world of a world—

The sea sloughing itself out of the deep,

Glorious, silent city,

That no one dreams of leaving.

The Legend of Lightning by William Butler Yeats

All night I lie awake
Hungry for bread.
The town near me is full
Of overturned shops
And boarded houses.

Firemen and doctors
Are on their knees
At the window
Beneath the scaffold.

O keys!
O keys!
Go outside
And take the dog.

All night I lie awake
Hungry for bread.
The town near me
Is full
Of overturned shops
And boarded houses.

Flames whirl for no reason
As the moon litters low,
And the street lights
Become a trothal of light.

All night I lie awake
Hungry for bread.
The town near me
Is full
Of overturned shops
And boarded houses.

Now, maybe,
Night has come,
And the fire has done its job,
The moon has gone down,
The street lights have dimmed,
And the sky has come down.

All night I lie awake
Hungry for bread.

In a squalor, a passing taxi driver said:

I had never looked at a building this way before.
Night sun trying its luck
waitting by an alley to catch a light,

or walked around the corner of this house,
and shouted “To the glorious train!”
I wasn’t there’t. I never watched:

the dirty-dazed eyes of the author
and his friend, the sober eyes of the author’s wife,

and the hard heart of the writer
who thinks a freewheeled blog is funny and (it’s true) freaks out

at everything it does.

Some days I don’t want
to write, I sit on my

the following passage from

“The Love I taste in my mouth
has been cut into pieces
and scattered like flowers,

bean and sprigs of it,
colors of the ocean and stars.

I write the next sentence
with my fingers

and keep repeating it.

I have too much time!
I’ve just enough to pretend

I’re not at all sick.
I bear a special place

in memory of those who died
at the hands of Dictators and Soldiers,

as well as those who willingly
voluntarily walked

under the prison walls
to occupy that space

where words spill like sand
where nothing is left standing

like ripples on the great ocean,
where the waves are making

We are approaching death
w/ a smile,
not blind

I beg of God
to let me
use my last breath
not as the death
but to move forward

continually,
without shame,
into my own personal

nowhere
where people
speak of the weather
hearing moon

at the top
of the stairs—
a feeling
that keeps

going,
until every voice
in the world
calls me back,
and I come out

of my shell
like a phoenix—
an angry
but happy

transformation.

In the dream
I am on fire
that is going to burn
to ashes

I am not
the kind of woman
that I thought I was

but I am glad
to be
a wordless cry

not crying
from the flame
that is going to burn

and to keep

The World Equinox Part 4 by Rachel Richardson

Paleontologists have fifteen different kinds
of dinosaur bones, some of them
thirty feet long. But the most valuable has
all been lost for good. The world’s first giant ant
got stuck on the roof of a museum as if
it had escaped from some power plant.

Weaving himself back into a heap
of them, tree-sized, he began to dig
his fist into the twisted earth.

A thousand years later, he turned his attention
to one thing that wasn’t there.
Earth, his eyes said, is one of nine
continents to frame a different face.

hand over your milk, form up your dog,

When the tide, the waters, feel great,
never be surprised that they stay.

You are not to touch anything.
Don't you dare rub your wife's her arm.
Do you think you can dance it blue?

Remember how lovers drink wine in the car,

then a glass of water, and then

a third; and then another?
Beware that, if you drink,
the others, too, will return,

and die in the wake of you.

The Night by Eileen Myles

As the night my loved's head
wobbles downward until
it hits her and she lies

blind on the dark until
one eye rolls into her,
the other out the window,

sitting up, sliding down,
as the car rolls out of

on her leather jacket
climb into her lap, then back,
her hair falling back

into the dark as she tries
to figure out which is her

and which is who, my favorite

I turn off the TV, watch her
sit up through the night, hearing her

the words come back, the night
making a meal of her, and remembering

the ways I neglected my own
//particularly my own dreams,
the excess, the

wanton, the geek thinks it is

cool to wear pants to work,
the light shining through
a decorated window,

but I’m still a girl, not
young enough for bed,

still there in the dark,
daring to lie down on my
carpet, breathing the

dark, while the car
rolls to a stop, and I stand

a hair away from the door,
holding the reins,

a girl I don’t think
I know anymore, still

leaving the dark
tied to the door,
in the driver's seat

while the light
gels inside the door,
then slowly moves

from one end of it
to the other,
then west, then east

to the other,
this worn-down old
where my body wasn’t

made of Styrofoam and leather,
never worn

again, I stood

shoving the reins
against the sill,
shoving them

onto the blinds and
The merest thought

that I might

be good at this,
that I

couldn’t wait

Year of the Elephant by Robin Ekiss

In the free world, the elephant is dead,
the yellow is gone, the garbage is festering,
the yankee has taken up residence alone.
The best interviewer is still out there
wanting a job because the chair
was made to sit down and set
even the most venal volitän
is dirty as mud. In the
elimination roundtable
of the showbusiness "expert"
on the row, neither the elephants,
nor the haters, nor himself
are happy about that,
yet the elephant, still at the head of
the line is the best.

The Fence by Daniel Hernandez

The fences were coming down. The fences in Fermín, the fence in the park, two fences in the park, two fences in the park. As my daughter collects her things
I want to stand in the middle of the street and say:Who are you? You're an empty wall.

The fences are coming down. The fences in Fermín
this evening.

We walk to the curb, and the trunks shake,
one car imperceptibly
wiggling out of a dustbin
on the highway.

The tires of cars stand on end,
all white as the line between road and curb
no longer exists. The fence
that doesn't exist
is coming down.

My daughter collects her things
and stands beside a fence.
"There's no one there," she whispers.
"Someone is going to come back," I say.

Her face radiates with excitement.
"There's people going to come back, baby," I say.
"What do you want, you'll get," she says.

The Dirty Gear (Smile) by French Denton

The Dirty Gear (Smile)
is the secret of how the Yemeni children are carrying and using
the bomb in their lapels, getting a free ride
on trucks and buses, eating an oily, white protein shake,

doing drugs and having abortions in factories and markets in Jizan.

Shabbir Ahmed, alias Abu Basir
Tied to the Walls, adored by the Women
Wandering by, women who dwarfs and dwarfs
with the old and the young, some who look like pigeons
who rot figure in the wall like bird racoons.

There are places where old clothes
are blackened, and there are places
where the puppets are painted in dim ink
on the walls of dark rooms.

The women who parade down these streets
staggering to the track to the pits of the tracks
are holding up their hands
until the cameras are not rolling.

The women who walk past these dark streets
often think to ask the men to wait
for them; they are lucky they can answer
when the doors are never slammed
and the cars have never been repaired

when a girl tos and frot has nothing
to wear and the only thing to do is sit
at the kitchen table of the woman who sits
and tattoos.

Comforter by Jacopo Polosa

The silver letters she had read opened
like the mouth of a long pasty face,

wrapped around the crook of my leg
with her finger and the last thing I knew,

I was crawling under one foot,

gaining speed as I turned and ran
until I saw a yellow trail of snow

running behind me, and so forth
in the cold of the night.

The Lost Cat by Rodney Torreson

He woke up
in a rickshaw pulled by the trailer behind a bar in Baltimore.

He was a cat
who had wandered miles
in a light-colored coat
&amp; under a blanket
to find himself free.

Although he had no fur,
he looked a lot like a rabbit,

especially in the documentary shots,
which captured his every move.

He ate candy &amp; drank coffee,
stayed with a girl who worked in a salon.
The story would end,

but the hitch with the hair
was the girl’s.

At night he became a familiar figure,
the subject of movie after movie,

a likely cape in the line of a windy wind
that knocked at the door where a child
was curled in a pink ball and reading.

The girl’s sister's friends refused
to come to watch it.

To the Poems Untaught by Anonymous

The words I write
and have no voice
Go where no one hears
Because I am still
A child who has no father
And no mother.

I am the briefest form
And the best of what is being
Young and fat and bad and vain
And fortunate;
But the words that come
Clap against my eyes
Like aureole of a young man
Making a way to heaven.
That's why I am here
Today, remember,
And that's why you’re there.

With Leeches and Blood-Buds by Hubert Zamora

Yesterday I took some pictures
when a snail came by and dragged
a rosea from a nearby tree
back to my cabinet full of glass
and a fountain I seldom used
and then I saw in the mirror
a child wearing a yellow
t-shirt and a pair of boots
and said, “That’s me.”
And I was so in love with him
I didn’t even realize that
the camera wasn’t focusing on him
until I was walking toward him
to sit down
and I was sitting across from him
and I was certain.

The Happy Clocks by Elizabeth Alexander

My mother was proud and golden and got up
and brushed her messy hair. I sat in the kitchen
and I could see the way she didn’t care about
the clockwork of the world.

Stairs were similar. We were walking
to the library, and I fell down.

It hurt. I sat in a chair and I listened
to my mother’s happy noises.

I sat in the kitchen and I fell.
I can’t remember the real purpose of this life,
but I’m proud of the way I looked
and I’m glad I’m not such a poor girl.

Stairway to Heaven by CAConrad

We walk with you from here

a prayer,
a bridge to nowhere.

Come Sometimes by Delmore Schwartz

Come sometimes, a man of God,
A mount, a mule, all in a row,
To water from the well.     Come often,
Not to show off, but to herd.
Come to see the sunset. Come to haunt
A fountain,  A lighthouse, a cannery.
Come to see the way the earth is flat.

The gate at the back of the room
Is closed, and the bar is guarded
By a crowd of tourists with fake IDs.   I haven't found the stairs.

I don't want questions, I'ma take a nap.
I'ma lie in a circle and pray.

I'ma photograph my back while the sun’s high
A couple prance in front, snorting joints in their teeth.   I'ma write poems about boy bands.
I’ma write poems about boys who are on the high heels

And the fashion models who wear sneakers.   I’ma write poems about the guy at the bar next to mine.

A Boat by Robert Duncan

That thorn, that thorn, kindly palmyra,
Is leaving her, that thorn, that thorn,
I find, yet not for want of
Afe, but to me
A soul in need
Of an anchor, or for
Something really good.

And if, fly, if, bird,
Were to scrutinize
The fade and shine, both
Till they too should shrink
And be lost
At the same time,

I know
That by this song,
I shall make praise
Mighty for all that yearns.

where that wavering
one door’s,

That’s
what stops

domestic violence,

Nothing else

an inner bridge,
a memento,

to hold back

from the doorway’s

gerry knives,

to name

where it’s taken

to get there.

Toom by Kodama

I was buried in this flower.
September was a kind of gift.
Candor there was no treasure.

When I came to, there was snow.
I was the flower of that snow.

I was the flower.

The hot sun wheeled over my head
like a crescent on a sky
that no one took me for some

reason.
I was the flower and all the servants of the flower
were the trees under which we walked

to the church, to the streetlight, to the laundromat, to the breakfast
pot, to the rearview mirror, to the smiling faces
of the people inside the city, to all of this

and then for the tree, to the forest.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Frances Anne Kemble

We came to know
what life is without it.
When I was afraid
my heart fled
the fear-filled room,
we walked outside
in the open air
and climbed a clearing
of mulberry trees.
A cowbell rose
on a branch
pilates from the tree
and slowly turns.

Everyone walks
the same way now.
Says,it’s okay
to feel old.

And the sound of rain
in the open air

is the greeting
of the neighbors
who have moved
and who have
caught fire
bouquets of the things they’re used to.
The pieces
of our lives
we had forgotten
are slowly coming back.

The Way It Is by Larry CadFeder

a kind of intimacy

being pulled over
by a stop sign.

The sound of sirens
licking the car,

not lacking any

narratives.

“A shy person
out of the frame

who can’t help it.

We use our phones
to run our fingers

over notes, wanting

more to speak

than a silence,

a grinding, what

could have been
if we had

a different accent

weren't

even half-

way there.

A waiter,
hoping to hold back

the last table,

said, “If you

want a table,

come here.”

The look
I got once

was beautiful.

Even now
the way it is

runs in my veins.

Cuff my body. No more milk.

I’ll lick the ashes in the sun.
So will I.

Sign by Maeve Higgins

The sign on my property reads
“buy milk.” I’ve always known
I’d have to work for my milk:
a bale of straw, a stake
in the ground, the first creak
of a gate. Not the loud scream
of the baby nor the crow,
not the bang of the roof. This
is the homecoming dance, her
mixed metal cushion overflowing
vaguely, her yen. I skip the braless
puck that glares in my drink,
I’m just so terribly sorry
for my failure to be hers.

what to say to get
to the end of a long road

or a community of

big-city may

leave a runway
of, say, those
who spring

from the mud
to sing about
the meaning of life.

SCC 50: There is no me by Jonathan Williams

There is no me,
at all, but the red-haired girl,

teeth pressed back,
pupil holding in a few dark hairs,

calls everybody to the church,
but everybody’s home,

its doors flung open,
the past and future,

the face that sailors upload,
indifference to even a pause,

a strange document:

a picture, stuck in a picture viewer

on the Beanie Head hotel drive,
the kind you might get from a garage sale,

the kind of document that has a face

and a traffic light on it.

“Sister Mary!”

“I’m going to the SCC Fellowship—

my mother says.

Jodie,

that red-haired girl is beside me.

The Flooded River by Anya Silver

I want to stand
on the obliterated
horizon and see
the sunset

lolling on a water-logged
beach. The end of the world
was just a dream.

I want to wear
an animal mask
and then walk

to the end of the world.
Then I will be
the mother, smiling
at my real daughter

before her every drag.
The flood waters will
clasp me to their straps
and I will be the shelter.

My daughter will be
the great cook,

the first to fold
her pillow, and

the one to clean
the stove, and then

the one to look
ahead,
not toward tomorrow,

to the end of our journey.

Falling Rain by Robert Hayden

They've melted
all this snow to
the ground. It’s not

the snow that falls on
the ground. It’s the rain

that’s sporadically
falling over the hill

the falling rain
that my mother

watches to see
what’s next. It’s

the rain that falls
so rarely I can’t

wait for it. I look
up at the sky

and see a clearing
&amp; a blackbird

come down over
the hill. I know

the rain will come
because now

it’s midday
and it’s dark.

And there’s no snow
in the day.

The rain just
moves slopily

&amp; reminds me

of snow on parked
trucks, lightening

in the sky, leaving a
little mess out
of the front yard,

the way the rain
has left this little

carpet of snow
on our front steps.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Edward Thomas

The autumn leaves that fell on your head
must have landed
softly
on your heart
—for
you must be familiar
with the word "over."

You look
at my face
in the mirror
and I remember
that summer
is not the time anymore.

You’re walking
with your feet
bent
in a slant garden.

You’re carrying
a new bag of candy
from town
to church.

I am not.
I’ve
never
done this
before.

I had
always
worked
after
evening.

I was
in a
good mood
that day.

You asked
me
to close
the window
in the living room
so you could
watch the sunset.
I refused.

So
I walked
way
away
from home
where
I worked
and
looked
up
to stare
at
the page
on the white desk

made
of bones
and wood and
legends.

Today has
no
place
in my
life.

I am
looking
up
at
the bird

that’s
flying
around
of course
and
instinct
like
a flea,

a dove,
a dove
flying
around
of course
and
instinct
like

The Dressbox by Petra Brimhall

My father craves a dressbox. He wears the dressbox to parties and makes the bride and groom change into different dresses.
Once I was the only child to go so far
that I could try on dresses and look in a mirror.
My mother does not believe that the dress box can be worn as an effective birth control.

My grandmother once said that the body must be protected from the body's own mistakes.
My grandmother did not believe her granddaughter's fairy tales about how much more people will happily pay for clothes
when we get married.

My grandfather had tried to kill himself.
When he at last realized that he had simply been playing a fool
and repenting his rage, he fell into the dress box and died.

Writers’ Eloquence in the Second Life by Teresita Olmecas

There is a season in print,
in the form of a book,
in the form of letters,

in the form of sentence.

The quatrain
between the wickered

horseshoe knuckle and shoulder
of the writer

in the face of the subject
of the book design

is the sentence,
the hidden form
in the meaning

of the form
in the middle

of the street.

It comes in twos,
the form of one

and the form of the other
are the letters.

The form is for a door
into a house,

light of the book
and face of the text

and face of the letter.

The form is for a janitor
at the house

who checks on the letters
inside a new book,

who locates the blue bug
inside the parlor of the house.

The form is for the music
playing outside the door
inside the house,

the form is for the janitor,
who stands outside

the door
and opens
the door
from the outside,

and the form is for an empty house
the form is for a dance
of the word

inside the door
to the outside,

the form is for a song
that is not

from the house,
it is a song
from the face of the letter.

The form is the letter,
the content is the form.

The singer is in the singing
of a book,

the medium
is one who sits
on the chair

and sings.

Pyrotechnics by Cathie Tompkins

Maybe I’m just desiring you
to confound me.

Someone once told me the pyrotechnics were stupid.

I don’t recall
the words that were spoken,

I’ll try to be
as nonchalant as possible.

If I am at the center of the pyrotechnics
I am not amused.

Or am I?

Nothing’s going to happen
assuming I don’t

otherwise assign an identity
to myself.

There is no being
elsewhere than me.

Who is it I leave
behind?

I am the umbrella
and my love

are the long branches

from which the pyrotechnics
launch themselves

into the air.

Who is it that I pick
up, pull, and carry

with me?

Is it myself?

Then who
are you to conduct me?

Who is it that you borrow
from me?

I am not going to say
yes to more than one partner.

I am going to say
yes but only to you.

Always pull yourself up by the scruff of the neck
and do not scold.

Never take orders.

You’re not going to be saved.

“Small Phoenix, and Little Phoenix in Heron” by Walter Clyde Curry

The little boy came from the flow
of her gushing feet
and the boat smelled of alcohol.

I had to teach him how to walk
because I could not unfold
the canvas on my back but he sat still

and read in the fantastic book
and a man and a woman
put a kettle on the stove.

We stood at the edge of the kitchen
and the gray cat suddenly seemed a serious matter
and I was angry with him
and I would have likely yelled
but it was not my place to make decisions
and the intercom roused and rattled.

When the little boy,
again and again, arrived,
the man and woman put him in the
helf where the carpet was
and he remained asleep

until the rain had soaked the glass
and the two women burst into tears.

He never let you down, or the neighborhood
without a conscience.  He was the most loving parent
you could ask for.  He was a queer Jew that loved even
the tiniest thing.  Uncle Joe, though he gave his back
to the neighborhood, told you, “sieg heil.”
And did he ever.  And did you ever.

Why I Carry a Gun by Tobias Wolpe

Why I carry a gun
is such a trivial piece of bloat
that somehow I never get used to
that I might need it,
and I can envision next to no consequences
for doing so. The gun is not
a threat to anyone unless I shoot it
then leave it to explode,
I can imagine. The gun is
indispensable for creative destruction.

One day, my body will be so weak
I can't even walk,
the gun will still be there
and I will shoot it
to send it flying over a thousand feet
and kill or maim a few people.

What would be the consequences
of this trivial life? I can tell you
that God will be happy
if I just get used to it
and don't try to put it off.

Dry November by David Wojahn

The winter I’ve had, it’s full of the sense that it’s over
because I’ve been waiting and waiting
for this to happen for years, and to have the tricycle
that I never had, and the bicycle that I never will
look back on again.
It’s almost winter in New York, and snow is

starting to come down in a big haystack
on the abandoned building next to the bridge, thick
grayish white snow, and the long winter
has finally come and gone, and I’ve almost forgotten
that there is a big white old house in Brooklyn
and it’s empty, and why this stair
needs to be pushed up so that I can step

down in it all, like my mother’s face
on the news: a man with a broken hand
walks by, and I am reminded
that when I am not reading, I am usually thinking of
the bicycle I promised to find

when the weather turns cold, and I am happy
to have it in my house, somewhere,
where I can look up and see the world moving on.

The Time of the Boat by Yusef Komunyakaa

When I see my name
in the willow leaf names
I sell in the Derwent Market
This is not a dream

I am in a sunset
a boat with a net

I am in the middle
of a forest and

I am in a wheat field

I am moving past fields
I am moving past the river

I am going through a forest

I am moving past people and
climbing a white rope

I am going to a house
that I am standing in

I am not moving
I am

I am not moving
yes I am

I am moving

I am moving, I am moving

I am moving through the forest
I am moving through the river

I am separating people to stand in the middle
bottles of smoke

I am putting my hands inside
the rope I am putting my feet
in the middle of the river

I am going to this house
I am going to my own house

I am going to the bridge

I am going to this kitchen
I am going back

I am going to the kitchen
I am going in here

I am going back
I am going to the stairs

I am going inside the house

I am going back inside the kitchen
I am going back with you

I am going in here
I am in this boat
there is a door

I am going in.

Sickle Pat
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Scott Cairns

A sickle Pat
 for color and a spur Pat
for feeling and a sinister hand;
Paps and decliners and an occasional Crow Pat—
These are, without a doubt, the most important colors in my life.
I look for them at the market, at nail &amp; gasket,
at the pawn-shop or the thrift store.

I love to see the ones I like
the most in pairs and in trios.
Paint one or two stripes,
slip the other over.

Fawns by Sarah Lee Masters

It is not a bird
I have seen
from the trees in May
fennel, chingilla, or guinger
Lunar fawns once again
have moved north

I have heard
a lot about
the pine trees
their high temperatures

whether they are hunting
on the ground
or flying over their nest

I have no idea
but I have heard
they’re hunting
on the ground

lyons and watercress
windblown shelter
caves of unknown origin
wildflowers

they have eaten
the seeds
of certain trees
and birds

I have been asking
what is burning
like a fawn
sitting in the moon
not moving

lunar fawns
are they flying
over this nest
that has been
found in sand

I have never seen
a fawn
standing
unafraid
in a night
of light
to be muk-ra-ka

I have been looking
for definitions
of the word
fawn
and what does
it mean

and I have
found one on a
web page dedicated
to the meanings
of the word
fawn

that is
the meaning of the reason
for killing
a little girl

“From the Period of the War with the Fever of the Heart” as a Poem for a Long Time Under the Sea by Anonymous

From the period of the war with the fever of the heart,
within the town below, a mass of men and women from the subversive ranks
finding themselves on the razor's edge

of the town below.

Sipping their coffee in the cafe where they came from, the women

said goodbye, and went on into the assault on the city below.

By The Sea by Richard Wilbur

And the tides have swept us off.
We are collected in a room, said the librarian,
to the library of your face,
to your writing.

And so we have been locked out.
We are brought in to a room.
The tall white desk,
where I once sat and listened
to the sea,
where I once sat and listened
to the waves.

The sky is falling.
The sky is red.
The sky is blue.
And the books are melting.
The sea has broken their backs.

The sea has gone!
We are the ones who’re crushed.
We’re the ones who’re caught.

And we are still dazed with the lights —
though the lights have dimmed.
And the books are burned.

Or are they?

Once Upon a Time by Robert Frost

It was a lovely November day,
The day the house was home,
And cozy were the nights,
The parlor was a-changin',
The lawn was a-raisin',
And there was a picture book
Everywhere

When I turned on the TV.
I couldn’t see the first movie,
But it was the first
One that made me smile.

I said it was wonderful,
And I would have said the same
If it had stayed on.

It did for a while.
And then I went to bed
And woke as soon as I was
Downstairs,

Downstairs, down the stairs!
Once upon a time,
Once upon a time,
Once upon a time,
I went down the stairs in my house

And only then did I notice
That I had forgotten
About that picture book!

Sarabande by Thomas Campion

Alive at last

Death, the corpse

I leave behind,

I do not pass

Without

A spirit

Of defiance

And proper

Anger

Of seeing its interest

Assaulting

The careless fancy

Of leaving the time

Into the slack

Oval of suspense

If I say I am going

I mean it

And I should

Speak the

Nowhere

Into the wood

Of prophecy

As however if I

Think of

Half a river

And half a tree

How long

And how fair

Saying

‘Trouble is

Over in the country of the dead

The path

of a river

Straight through me

and the world of the living

The Story of the Disappearance of My Father by Henry Wadsworth Long

It was a cold day and I was standing on the terrace
under the scorching sun. One of the stones
I was sticking to, the grouse that I had trod
as I walked for days, calling out to the ghost
of my father. When he turned up and looked too good
to be dead he said:
“This is it, my boy. This is the end.”

[The Dark/When the buried sighs no more] by Rhyanhilde Craig

The Quiet Rain
I want to stay in the dark.
No light
On the windowsill
Stays on the fenders for a lifetime.

The quiet rain
Stays on the fence.
The fences have metal buttons.

The quiet rain
Stays in the fence.
It has patches.

The quiet rain
Steals the fence.
I am not afraid.

The quiet rain
Hangs on the fence.
The fence is a woman.
The woman is elderly.

The quiet rain
Stays in the shadows
For a lifetime.
When the sun rises,
The whistle blows,
The wind picks up its breath.

The quiet rain
Steals the fence.
It has no arms.
It has no legs.
It has no foot.
The fences have a broken heel.
The fences have a broken toe.
The quiet rain
Steals the fence.
The light is needed
To read this poem on the bed.

“Pitiful Pencils for My Teeth of a Child”
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Juan Bradley

You can’t learn to set a condom down
or erase a footprint
but you can learn to get a shoulder from
a tree and then it’s not so much

getting a piece of you out
but having a piece of you

and of you


Your warmth and the silence of knowing
is like a sick room on a desert island
where you’re alone with your life
that nobody offers you.

Your skies and the birds that sing in them
are like a blessed Rastarnath in my mouth
where I shave a little bit

and they’re not anointing;
you are so beautiful
and if you were here, what

would you do
without your hands?

I’ve heard from teachers
that you’re so bright
and so kind
that everything I do is dandy;

and I hear that you’re very brave;
but who is brave
when he’s afraid? I’m afraid of

the darkness of being afraid.

A Coral by Bernard Broé

From the sea,

from the coral,

I’ve learned

that the greatest of sorrows

are knowing,

knowing the wonderful

Coral Reefs are gone

(for good reason)

and that I’m not alone

on this earth’s unlit

mountains,

on the great plains

where the water rolls

through broken dunes

and frees

wood barns,

even from this vantage

hear the Coral

sing on,

sing with the sea

as I have for years

when my children

go to the beach to come back

and to look at the new creation,

knowing that no new ocean

will ever be empty

and nothing winds up

on a reef’s support

and no need to run to a place

where I shouldn’t hide

from the ocean’s disapproval.

Wallpaper by David Wojahn

It’s like the one in The Constant Gardener,
where the trees are photo-real.

You’re in your room,
the magnifying glass is on,
you’re alone.

It’s so quiet that I like

the really quiet spot,
if only to scream silently

at something.
I’ve done this

before,
I’ve seen it done

before,
I’ve done it this way

Papá by J. Allyn Rosser

He was the first black man to speak in a Korean cafe

despite a Roofsby-like vocal deficiencies

Untermeyer, the Hungarian
Chadwickian of the street
I mean a human being
who knew how to move
what we mean by "disemboweled


heckled at the nose
and chin
the chin won’t rise
the nose won’t fall

he was even biracial
he could turn a black man’s head
and feel blackface
we did not want

he had the lackadaisical
unpredictable enthusiasm
of someone who felt
the need to clean a ceiling
or ride the subway

it’s hard to pin him down

he was taller than me
even though we were mostly

the same height

The Woman in the Window by Vicki Sorensen

Who is she? You have never seen her.
You walk a long hallway
debating who will blame her
when she leaves the house after dark
and does not return for hours.
Who is she? You have never seen her.
You climb the stairs
to the fourth floor
and reach for the hand
that is still resting
on the curtain rod,
not looking back
to see the face
behind her back
as you walk to the kitchen
with a cup of coffee,
your hand
on the stove,
your gaze
on the ceiling
winding between two
ducks on the ice
and back
to the woman
who has not
walked out of the house after dark
since you have not
seen her.

Prayer by Robert Burns

Now we are the friends we wished to be,

And together we could love no more.

The sight of your beauty
Restores our hearts to love.

The Man Who Met the Mammoth by Sandra Beasley

My mother went to visit the man who made her feel special.
An animal, of course, but also—no—a kind of magic.
He was a great admirer, and she loved to think
the deer caught in the trapdoor that fell,
the earth was made of butterflies and the moon
was a can of worms. But she had never seen him,
and it was a real risk, to look—even in the photo
in the absence of the frame, the man still looked
stubbornly at her, and beyond the photo
the man, who was in the photo, was nowhere
to be found.
I melted. I was so jealous, I melted.
I am smiling now, thinking of you.

The Other Side of the Farmhouse by Robert Hayden

They ballyhooed us from the lower deck,
the blankets fetching the mums.

My mother sat in the soundproof booth
watching the rest of the orchestra keep her brain alive,

her words crisping the air around them
like pancakes falling into a slow-cooker of rice

and back again. She was living, her page
on the ice was frozen and her hours

in the sun-battered yard were slipping into heat
or heat into the kitchen cubicle,

or my brain. She was almost
lovely. She sang about love,

open-mouthed, flat-palmed, in front of a plate
of chicken nuggets, who would have had preferred

a longer tour to follow the corn to the next field,
but who was coming along,

unreservedly, as the tour guide would have it,
to carry us back, to the end,

to a stealthy car that looked like a distant farmhouse
with three white doors and the look on her face
was not weary or uncertain or sad.

How could we be happier?

the unassuming philosopher
who’ll be noble

The first breath, that’s pure nothing

bodies make at the opening
of life. She’s either the breath

you are said to have committed

or the one you have not.

The Hanging Gardens of the Willamette Valley by David Bottoms

Where snow comes
to sleep at night.
Where there are no
winds, no
bird calls,
the mountains are silent,
the wind dissolves
to a sky
of bright car lights.
Where the trail
of tired footsteps is made
by the late
hucksters, and no one
has to carry shoes,
the trail is out
strewn with cans
and bottles,
and every place
where the breeze​ “purls,
drips, and spills,
the leaves are green.
Where the house
is made of piles of sticks
and stacked
on top of another
made of sticks and stacks
of sticks and stacks.
Where the fallen
angel is hidden
and waiting
for his fate,
the land is made
of damn near everything
I’ve wanted to be, but
not the kind of crazy
yuppie land that’s
being rented out.
My land is beneath the earth,
not walking on it.

Echo by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

What are you taking from the world that is yours?
A cow and a rat after a race,
A bird and a crow
About the same nature,
And most of all love,
Those two cows.

A cow and a rat
Are two livestock.
You have nothing to eat but love
The calf, the rat,
The ox.

Resident Evil by Thunderbird

We reached where we
had never been before.
We were tall
and blonde, had many
backpacks, each with
a desk and a pad.

Our bodies were paper,
made of a thin
&amp; light.

We ran through
townies in sandals.

We didn’t dare
touch the poles sticking
up from the ground.

We shoved
back on the train
&amp; walked
down the aisle
to a dark blue
gown. It was

sunny that day.
We weren’t
in the business
of killing.

I was in
the back of the car,
facing
the back seat.

I couldn’t
see my eyes,
&amp; the vision
of a man
in a burlap sack
rattling up and down
it an upside down

beach that I witnessed
and I could
be inside.

The screen flashed
a woman. After
she died
my vision
shot upward
a little on my
right side.

It took
a whole labor
to stay
where I was
and take the part
he wanted me to play.

A Lot by Frank Stanford

I look through a gate into
A small room filled with the
Dead, who've never
Made it here.
What is the room
For? Is that a hose

Raked behind me
To hang the laundry above my head? Lock
The door, and I'll be back
As if nothing happened.

The night never sleeps,
The light never dims,
The spiders that watch it
Sail off, never

Running out of breath.
It's morning, and like
A waterless cauldron
In the eye, my mother would say

Is that a child?
Or someone else's,
Like the one I was seeing
Behind the window? Even so,

It's not like that to me,
Although I am anxious
To get back to my place,

Which I thought was a house.
But this is like a train,

A strange train, or a bed
I have years to fill:

Do I even need a roof,
When I'm already on top,

Or do I just want to stay in my place?

coming from upstairs.

I get up
and go outside

with my toes.

I sit in the shade

and watch the clouds

The Thing About the Toothbrush by Pauli Murray

What was it I had said
about teeth that ran

toward the nose? It’s possible
that I had said all of my

oars were fucking
a perfect toothbrush heads down

into a clean mouth and back

to the blacks of my face, running
into the cocked gun, the gun

down the middle of the lineup, wheeling

the baton, the streets waltzing past

in a procession of debris, the silent

toothed teeth in the toothbrush mouths,

the spunky tang of my voice

wresting dirt in the teeth

make me daring

to love you,

leading a lost march

of the funicular

behind the train,

poised above the fray

of the screams,

the big metal motion of my face

as I slip the flat

circumference of the traffic

chrome into a fender,

in the heat of the moment

whoa, whoa, whoa,

accelerando,

the thing about the toothbrush

licking the snow off my arm

into my mouth,

the thing about the toothbrush

thumping off the snow
off my breath,

a giant, unfancing black smirk

After the Aurora by Miriam Bird Greenberg

Follow the path, the light,
no need to feel guilty, and the long
way home. Be sure the house

is still standing, that it has not
fallen during the night, and that the floodlights

will not spark once the moon stops
shooting into the distance. And, following

the path, always remember that the rose

will never say goodbye, until you

lay your hair behind the door and turn

to go. Pick up your shoes, and kneel

before the stove in the dining room.
The dog, who knows how to drop

a leash or sit up, will lead you

inside. See how the second hand

is always slipping out from under

the first, and I am wrong

about this: I have grown so used

to having the body,

caught up in the concept of

stuff and bubbles. And my feet

have grown so tall and heavy

that I cannot walk

and walk and walk,

and not be afraid

when I am about to go.

On a Stone by Michael Anania

Canon:
Μεγδειναι
Remember those places
where I had to cross
the river, often alone
with what had to be found
there, what had to be

found.
So that’s why I’ve
never stood on the bridge
lifting my hat.

Which is the better image
of the universe,
to be born
only on your birthday
or to have lived
on a footbridge
for seventeen years?

Except that living
on a footbridge is
not like the image
of the universe.

Like the image of the
protector who
comes to the village
to take away the boys

who’ve wrecked the place
that is your life.

Only like the image
of the river,
which keeps
breaking open
only one dam

does not
make a perfect
bridge, making
a bridge

or a stair.
Still, the image
of a little boat
lying on the bottom
of a mountain

with a sign
on the bottom
of the hill
on a rickety
car

and the river
inside it
has been
broken into
pieces and thrown
back to the top
or to the side
of the hill.

I wanted to make
an image of the
little boat
on the bottom
of the mountain,
and the little
car on the top,
and the river
inside it,
and the little
boat
on its side,
and the little
chicken that
pees on a tree.

In the house of mind

not to dress this way.

If I felt threatened,
I would not wear a bathrobe.

If I did not know
how to walk through

the dark, I should not
be drinking that evening and

spending the night upstairs.

Never mind the price,

I would not be
stepping on the gas (
I’m not sure what to call

that feeling of space

that my mother wore

when she stood
and twisted to us,

her long red skirt
on the screen

offering more than the street
to the street below.

And if I did
not know

to be silent
or to feel shame,
I should not

know, because I did not know

The Folding Chair by John Leo

Half of you are off the road
and the other half are here.
You’re on the cushion or in the chair
while the damaged ones
make pilgrimages to the bench
where a traveler once
spoke quietly, as though he didn’t
know where he was going.
You’re looking up,
waiting for the light to change.

You’ve brought a book,
which I assume is poetry,
or perhaps a song,
to read after the work.
I stick the book to the seat
where it’s for sale.
I don’t care if I belong

make anything wet or sour
enter my body

I was not allowed
to talk or hear my voice

I was not allowed
to see my own body

I said

how many people
have died’ under these circumstances

which do not

strengthen the arms or
the hands or

the whole body
to fight the mind

or to get over it

where the mind
can not

because it is not

generous
because it is not

thoroughly reflective
because it is not

I get the feeling that, in the heretofore
murky netherworld, I have not traveled too far,
am I not a long way off?     I have,
as they say in daytime, a long way to go.

I hear the familiar sound of my own voice--
like a classroom where I am a teacher
holding the same book which just happens
to be my school notebook.     I have said the right
thing
to my students, and I have been
truthful     at all times.

But this morning I listen
for the sound of my own feet
and I can hear them, when I am
all alone, saying the wrong thing.

What is the wrong thing?     I don’t know.   Maybe
something nice?   Maybe a forest
full of lovely animals and birds?

I am sure I am one of the few teachers
who can teach my students how to say the right thing.

The Fugue by Iliez Cato

It took me a long time to master the black-and-white photograph of my wife.
In the end I moved on rather than owning the room.

Later I realized I had intended to paint a life
but whose eyes were just too dim to handle the light.
Later, I realized I had intended to paint a life.

Early Sunday morning I awoke before my wife
and drifted off to sleep. On Monday I tried to sing
Meet Me in the Square

while standing on the New York street that will never be
an aisle


where a still portion of the tree collapsed
just as I was

and the tree, once it was to remain,
floated up and broke and fell behind
a building

when the building was right next to me.
I must have moved at least twice
during the day, was, or will be,

when it will stand
again and falls again

and I will be there

thinking now and then
of that photo

I took of my wife
just before she died

and the silent line
of the pilgrims
falls from the sky

and it is neither here nor there
I should say


but never will be,
if it ever gets there

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Jesse Addonizio

First the sun rose
and a wave of clouds

burst over the valley

like austerities
adrift in the deep

like aural orgasm

to come to a stop

on the hill’s rim

where I could see

the tide curve

as if a boat

were just keeling over a gully

and then

a gleam rose on the horizon

and a hooded figure

was keeping a sharp eye

at the sound of the chimes

belonging to the city of angels

for as long as the sun stayed

on the horizon’s rocky face

while a werewolf raged

I watched as he

crucified the city

and the only sound

were the chimes.

I remember thinking

every deputy knows

what’s at the center

of this madness

but if God was here

he would know what

was it like

to be a boy in front of a werewolf

and a werewolf in front

of a city in the desert

and a werewolf screaming

no.

Ace Ball by Michael Murchison

The first time I saw Ace Ball
hope for just
a plane,
the first time I saw

a deer,
he looks
the slightest bit young
and I may

have thought he’d
been dreaming
about the deer
licking his black
trail,

the hunt
even getting close
as the old man

walked around

the cornfields
with a cane,
like he used to
do,

fingering the ends
with his cane

to look
parents in the eye,
like Ace Ball

had a cane,
a cane,
a cane

on one knee
and a big

hole in his
face,
like a man

he is
wearing
a big

casket
and a mustache

for support,
like I’d

never had
a soccer ball
in my life,
so I break

the ball in half
and throw it
at a little girl

who’s playing,
a little girl

playing in the opposite
position to the one I
had played,
a little girl

playing in the
same way I had
done before

Pop, Pop, Duracell!

The Soothing Special
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Kate Farrell

The showman lies back,
licking his pizza,
a few red cheeks
in a kiss,
smiling,
talking,
lifting a finger
to his lips
to his forehead,
twirling his lips
and that's not the end.

The sun is important,
but not as much as the rest,
heares it’s funny
a lot,
it’s not
unbearable

“Scarlet Boy” by Matthew McConville

Scarlet Boy
is so cute.
I bet he’s smart.
Does he say
“Marcy”?

Does he stand
with a cane?

 Does he have
a clawed shoe?

Does he cry
every time he’s

bullied?

Does he know
that a toy is

The Big Bang?
Does he know
that riding


scooters,
using his ROOF,
iscool, special,

was an invention
and not the

Swiss Army knife?

Does he have
a rug
to wrangle

a mowing machine?
I could use

a dish cloth
to hold
an egg.

Heart of the Dog by CAConrad

— Lorraine Moten

Forgotten now, can we get back
to what the dog said?
Let’s focus on the answer.
A small fist

was all he needed to know
to tell us he’d been bitten.

Forgotten now, can we get back
to the very dog whose words
set off a chain of events
and left us all a-walking

through the house of bones
and the ocean’s swirling filthy

beams of salt and clamoring,
shameless and aggressive.
A small hand

was all he needed to know
to tell us that his paw

was the one who got bitten.
Little one?

Forgotten now, can we get back
to the very dog whose words
bound our lives together

into the embrace of something
we couldn’t have changed?

Funeral by Donald (Grady) Davidson

Passing, with a lazy jerk, past the boarded-up cemeteries,
The baker's, like the street of the dead;

In a dimly-lit room where the casket was locked
At the top, a white of logarithms
A beaded hose, filled with molten lead,

Spike-nosed, in the face,
Crossed by a strap from the casket,
As I pass; as I pass,

Only beggar-like, a slouching bum,
With ragged, toothless hair,

Loosed with a scuff of bones,
Gligarly, grubby, unpressed,

Sewn with it, hang-dog, with a lice-ridden face,
Picking up the bones as they are lost,

Like scraped-up handkerchiefs,
Worn, rotting, in the post-mortem
Sorter, faster than being interred, I am

Taken home to my bereavement
And the people who were just like me.


In Buenos Aires we like to sit in a corner
And have a drink, or a bit of conversation,
For there is only one other person there,

This local who has never been to Argentina
And has been to the United States only once.
If I were in his place, I would read him my last rites
and say,Grady, thank you. To "Eat for the Mindful"

is a joke, but there is much to be said
For the people we pass, for the others

We have come to love and for whom our lives
Are not harmless slow-jumps, but real,
And who have shown us more than others
The way to become a person.

The Landscape by Eileen Myles

The very scent of the place I grew up in
is seductive—the alfalfa
pale, the lavender
evergreen, sweet smelling.

The sun sinks behind the hills
and they whisper from the houses
and the yard and the wrappers
in the corner of the grocery store
that it will stay there
and come again.

The air
is one hundred percent decorous
and neatly frilly
and clean and nice
and there is music
in every room
and a water fountain
in every tub.

The earth is free herring
when I pull the pruning knife
by the roots
and drop it into the earth
and it returns to the sea
and it is the earth
that comes up around the roots of a tree and
climbs into an oar
and the white car of the driver
coming up behind it

and I’m there again
searching, a wing
not without me,
but we’re converging
as if we’ve never parted
before when I say
“The landscape of my life”

A Scent of Laughing By Richard Wilbur

He did not know what he was doing.
He was a child who went outside
And learned to make himself an art.
Then he danced. Then he sang.
He did not know what he was doing.

There are two kinds of flowers, the kind
That Look like the Sweet Smell of the Sun.
And the kind that Look like the Musk of a Worry.

And that is not pleasant.
That is not pleasant at all.

He did not know what he was doing.
He was going to be the most beautiful boy
In the whole world.

There are two kinds of men, the kind
That Wake up Every Morning a Happy Man.
And the kind that Stay Home and Forget.

Cats by Lawrence Ferlinghetti

In the street the cats are lined up,
The cat with her feet in the air,
The cat lying on the pole, the cat wearing
a baby mat or a scented bath

All the more delightful because it’s not
Your typical cat; she isn’t
The cat you think she is, she is

The cat with the big ears, the cat
Who’s always lying in the sun, the
Cat who’ll never get up from the pole,

The cat who has her nose broken,
The cat who’s always angry and crying
The way you are, but never shy

The cat who is always in a wheel,
The cat who is always on her back,
The cat who’s always ready to jump

At any moment from a high window
Locking her in their cage, the cat who
Appalls gets up and walks over

The window and looks around but
The window’s only open at night,

The cat who is always on her back,
The cat who is always in a wheel,
The lucky cat who’s never afraid

The lucky cat who will always love
You, the lucky sad cat who’ll never get up from the

Pale wall, the lucky cat who’ll always be
The lucky happy cat who can get up
And walk away from the public eye

To the private eye, the lucky cat who’ll never go out
Once, until your secret comes out

When I Look at You by Charlotte Mew

Because you are so
un-plastered,
I finish my watch
in an hour.

Because I’ve gone
pale, you are
almost invisible.

Because you’re
always smiling,
you’re our source of
advice.

Because you ride
your bike to work,
you’re the only
body who can give
in to the office politics.

Because you call yourself
an adult,
you need to get
a life.

Because you want
to dress
appropriately,
you need to do
something about it.

Because you’re a recluse
like me,
you eat dinner alone
and go to bed hungry.

Chant by David Wojahn

For the one who’d never “grieve”
When I’m gone, it’s for sure
And enclosed
In a liberality of words

And by no means
Nervous or in a hurry

Settled myself down
As my go-to solo song

To be sung by me
In a coffee shop somewhere

I leave the room.

Here I am,
With my own slightly shivery voice and

An empty chair.

On my way
I’ll never return

And how am I grateful

That I’ve missed my chance?

A Description by Robin Ekiss

In the labyrinthine atrium where I sit,
sleeping, I am surrounded by the sound of
the driver’s feet,
the night breeze, the curtained figure
of the windowblind opening
or closing. Sirens

and horns, the noise of four doors
closing, doors steadily starting
or stopping, and the night wind

trying to catch me. The tall
glass, the long mirrors, all
in a panic, as if I am
just the brain of a pigeon,

And as I try to remember the train
the name or what the name means—
all hard and beautiful work

or mindless play, all
a kind of surrender. It is
unemploymentable to work

in the thicket of this room,
hooked into the ceiling by the sound
or echoes of the latch,

to be completely alone
on the cobbled streets of Manhattan,
nearly the only silence

I would ever want, this drunk
singing in the dark or in the dark,

I am just a kind of vessel
that carries the meaning of an entrance
and an entrance

into a letter or into a subway
at the end of a long journey

for the words
that carry no meaning

but the same sound of hope
and love, I am

borne like a bird
by the sound of someone’s feet
and the soft, dried

lingering sound of the door.

And the network of tunnels and
ladders

the whole metropolis that
I have walked through

with my bare feet,
I have trod

under the great glass
that looks up into the desert

and down into the sea
and I have stood

to watch the quiet
birds of death

the star wolves
and their helpless

children

cowering under the metal
of a collapsed train and
the great windows

that have allowed
the building of a civilization

that has lost its

arable land
and is lying

over itself.

An 80-Yard Drive by Robert Miller

On the transition to shade
the earth takes over
and the meadow litters itself

with mimosa-mimosa, making
the peak peek around a tree

and the woodschooned depression
nearly 2 ft. tall

and the sheworn, orthophthalmic ridge
with a half-moon slant

to its base shoots
in a whirlwind of white,

and it could be the source
for the amber sea

on the hillside above the antique shop
or a nursery rhyme

or a spilled hibiscus.

Can you imagine a man leaning over
a cowling that little? Can you imagine a tree

stepping over a flake or two
on the way to a trunk or a knucklehead?

It’s not quite like the movie
—that’s implied
by a dingy dimpled skirt,

a sorry excuse for a sweater
and a generic t-shirt,

but living is hard and it’s not
every day you get to do it
and there’s a reason for that.

I’ve had this thing
going on for years now

where I’m either mutual or natur
and I’ve always managed to be some sort

of tragic hero who somehow
has to forgive — that night

when the storm came
I had a chance to pretend

I’m still in love with the snow and I
laughed — I’d walk home

in that duffel, maybe a wool sweater,
but only if it was wool.

The Boy Who Wet His Pants by Elfriede Wolpé

Let’s not help him, or
his mattress, because his mother
since he was an infant
has never done so.
Scrambling for whatever

distrust my nakedness,
but the threshold
of all that I will do
is when he’s a grown man,
not when he’s a boy.

Two front porches

I want

to walk

looking
up at the tree
a little way

where I see
a head
of a child
and, then,

the face
the body

the way
my voice

is balanced
with the
grounded earth
and the

pitch of the wind
and the

collapsing leaves
of trees

and the
flowers
and the

things that
I've learned
about love
will not make

backstories—
the
night, the

moon, the
bridge
and the

congoaning of the lark
and all

maddening noises
– every

song, every
chorus, every
blur, every blow

the way
the world is here—
my

cowboy ways
and my
sad ways

and my
lonely ways
and my
cavalier ways—

and the
things I have
done
by my
own
way, and

I am
getting

at the
end of
an old

End and Beginning by Marge Piercy

The end of my suffering is the beginning of my enjoyment,
final act of a creative play that avoids despair.

The beginning of my suffering is the end of a piece of work
that is already good but unfinished.

The end of my suffering is not a development of art
that has not yet achieved a mature feeling.

The beginning and end of my suffering
are two sides of the same coin, one of which
is the end of pain, the other an expression
of the end of pain.

The Spandrel by Edith Sitwell

I have no doubt I shall live to see that day
When I shall be as fair as I am;
When life and all the world shall know
That I am alive and worthy of all the rest;
When I shall be worthy of all the rest,
And the green earth shall once again tremble,
And the sea shall call my trade,
And the trees shall call my clamor?

Now, for Heaven's sake, if that day should come,
And that my life shall have me borne
Out of my labors and my sleep,—
I will go and be worthy of it!

Elegy by Kevin Forty

Why don’t we let the day pass
like the rest of us, eyes on the horizon,
chattering as the gossip seeps
through the walls of our heads that have known
safety, a lifetime of snobbish pride
so that we might leave a little something
to the economy and bring on the next day
a morning full of butterflies.

We could sit in the minifridge of the desk
and gossip about how much we actually owe
to this fourth wall and our own place,
the chamber pots and the fountain behind us.

Or we could just wake up and be like everyone else,
so excited to be leaving behind a legacy
that we would not hesitate to take our own life.
If it were just another job and the paycheck
was just another pittance, perhaps.

Yet the circus ends a little before it begins,
some time prior to the start of the day,
and we sit there, silent, toasting
the days that have passed,
and the empty promises that we could have
made if we had just braved the cobalt traffic
and wandered the dark corridors of a castle
that nobody would have ever heard of
before we headed into the open sky,
and was that all there was of that?

Apostasy by Linda Everwine

Remembering
What is left of us
Is not the city
(according to the bible)
but a town, a place of caves
with walls so thick
they were made of lava
and obsidian
and tunnels so deep
they reached the very edge
where stars come out
and start their own hours

Every night the same
gulls sat on a boat
and prayed
I still am alive
forever on the ocean--

The only place
I'll ever be
is sinking by the sun
and sweeping the earth
away

Loners
and closeted
songs
come to me
with poetry
in their ears

Some Sinners by Raymond Williams

I had a life. It wasn’t gay.
That’s what we said inside the house
that we couldn’t move out of.
It didn’t hurt that much longer
at the end of the streets.
The rain poured
and washed the windows.
A rusty Jeep pulled up
to a house in the middle of nowhere
and took off and closed
the door. I wondered
where was they going,
where was they going?
But then I noticed
a little gray box
tied around the back of a chair
like a little lampshade
illuminated in the sun,
and there it was again,
the same face,
the same mouth
of the same old gray face

and me asked again
if I’ll stay.

At some point I’m going to have to get up,

I’m going to have to assemble my thoughts,
I’m going to have to be patient.

Are you out there?

Are you alive?

Are you in the house?

Are you listening?

Do you want to know the name of the cat
that's sleeping at the door?

Can you imagine losing a cat?

I’m going to have to leave
my house.

I’m going to have to go home
and maybe a friend will sleep in another
house.

Are you upset?

The late plan,

of lying—
we hatched a plan
to clean a sacred place,
we dreamed a vision
of naive invention.

We knew
the sun rose
in a nice pink
room in a house
in a little town
in Kentucky
and it did.

We knew
he was into black
women and white girls.
We looked
up at our children
and said, it’s fine
if you’re
monstrously beautiful
and handsome
an older woman,
whose hair is crazy
and beautiful, told us
it’s fine
if you don’t
live on the ocean.
We were considerably disappointed
to learn that
he’s
just like us.

But a man on the

Serenade by Juliet Kohler

The sound of a symphony drowned from the windows and a van heave,
a woman on the wheel, her hair more than a foot off the ground,
her face slipping into silent crinkles as she drove

back home to the sea, her eyes half open,
her nothing but her hair and her wish she had never

to go back to where she belonged, unable to hear herself

in a string of turning cranes, another woman
on the wheel, her hair more than a foot off the ground.

The sea was not a woman, except for its blue tint.

It was the sound of an airplane.

It was the sound of a symphony drowned from the windows.

Rocks, flake of feathers, free will.

“A being is only its sound.”

“You’re only your sound.”

The sound of the symphony drowning from the windows.

Of course, there’s the whole effect of the sound of the symphony drowning.

Of course there’s the whole effect of the sound of the symphony drowning.

But as night fell, I was also drowning,
What once had been my home. And I knew the right way out.

At night it seems that you’re not going to be taken home.
But you’re never going to be taken home.

And so there comes a time when it’s really necessary.
And you’re there in the rain, the stars are clear,
and the sea, splendid,
is nothing but the sound of your voice
playing in the empty air outside.

From the Shadows by David Wojahn

Abandoned in a tidy spot,
snow on a dusty tree,

a single rock,
a brief trench
of water-worn ice.

Locking in slow motion

as I peel back the sheet-

pocked windowsill;
footsteps in the dark,

hallways still dark,
the hotel hallway

no longer a room
to go back to.

Next to the bed,
windows are clean,

there is no sign
that I am still

in the inn.

I’ve forgotten my password
or my name.

I’ve forgotten my phone
or my itinerary.

I’ve forgotten all together
of the days I have worked

on this house.

Sympathy by Hubert Zimmermann

The soft spring day the one
where a tree begins to twine,
where a berry falls,
where a ladybug lays her eggs,
In a gallon shock of red sunshine
one foot long, one inch wide,
a filthy pile of dog hair and hair,
like the unfinished sewer of a city.

Why did we not leave the confinement of our lives?
How much further will it take?
What will be the mountain to climb?

The moon is one month old,
and so is the T-shaped
crest, and the cornel
that is yellow, and then orange,
and then finally black,
and if i’m being realistic
i’ll sell my soul
for this friendship,
as we walk the path
between two rocks,
one of which is a fig tree,
the other a sapling,
and we sit upon a fig tree,
and the moon doesn’t
keep time, it’s just
a weather vane
at the end of the night.

The Far Country by Jennifer Coyle

My stomach ached like someone —he—rutted the mud
off the back of my chair, he held back his shirt
so the clouds could pass over me like a curtain

and never leave the house, the memory of it
lasted all day, and then all night, walking on the mud
always made me laugh.

He wore shorts, and the rain made sweat stains
on his arm, and he did what he was told,
at the end of the road, his face broke into a grin. We left

the road to follow it, so it could tan
like a horse hair seen through a window, we wandered
their afternoons back to the cabin, where we settled

with our meals, our sleep, and how much
we had eaten before we left.
The people laughed at each other,

and we weighed our options, and decided
to continue driving, out of habit,
for one more night, and that was before the earthquake

and snow and the smell of burned wood.

The Landscape by Stephen Dunn

Where did I go?
And where did I pay?
Luckily I am not a product of my own tragedy,

as I am dead to the world because I lived
unmanned: as if I had no purpose,
nor a desire for it. If I was in charge,

I would not sleep, nor on a structure in charge,
I would lay a hand on a woman who ran
against me, but I am not.

I am not either of these—
one is a scarf hiding a pair of shoes,
the other a pair of socks inside a coat.
If I had been the one who opened the door,
I would have gone faster, but no.

The Artist's Impetus by Robert Herrick

We are artists. We are so busy
Postured forgiveness, and, by no means,
Lust, only torrid will be there again.

We surround ourselves with patterns,
Make it so others satuate us.

Make art what you think it is:
True art if true art shuts out

the truer art and shoots
Inauthentic art straight to the wind.

Without art. Without hope.
Without art the world is nothing but despair.

Even the most sustained destruction of hope,
The most grievous failure to grasp its meaning,

If art is not art.
Even when art is art, even when

you think you know what is art,
You forget.

I'd become a bad mother.

The pain grew,
and I cried too.

I didn't know
that a woman

would put a wand up my nose
and sweep away my dreams.

No, I’m not a mother
with a wand,

a mother who loves her child.
I’ll tell you the truth,

but not the
bad mother.

I was never a bad mother.
I was a good mother.

The pain grew,
and I cried too.

The mother who loved me
was gone.

She’s gone now,
and I don’t know who’s
the son, the daughter, the
bad mother.

I’m a bad mother, dear;

I’ve taken an oath
to make sure that nothing

gives me away;
I’m the biggest witch

in the whole neighborhood.

I'm the worst kind,

the worst kind of mother.

You Have a Song by Stephen Dunn

You have a song
I hear it from across the table
and it has the right amount of cheer

you’ve been waiting for
to let me in.

I’m not even a woman yet
and this morning I was born

I did not pay for this
but you did.

I’m thinking, now,
how much of this

is just a song!

I will end this as soon as possible

and you will begin to sing it
in the manner I am trained to—

ask the question you think
it will ask, only then

you are ready.

After dark, from behind the porch
the helicopter, a motley crew
of motels, cuts, and bicycles,
a muddy haystacks, every sort of
adorned junk, from broken car parts, to
used car parts, to ripped-off catalogs,
to the stomachs of a vehicle, to the
unintended side of a bicycle

I’ve been to the garbage-man
who is near the river, for help
with a metal tube. The chopper
came down and did repairs
for me, all day, it was
just a matter of getting me there.
And I’ve been to the last of your
newscasts, and the odd
lunchtime interview, and to
the average dreary of the Sunday
morning, as I sit here now, I
look across the large, iced
open audience, who looks back to me
then back to them, and to you
you can’t have it both ways:
talking about what’s important
while trying to be the best
thing in the world, while trying
to be as good as you can be.

A Superintendant's Loafer by John Tortorella

the feelings

The Great Grey Wolf by Elizabeth McFarland

I was looking for washing hands
and criss-crossing my body
with tufts of fur from the great grey wolf I had seen
a few nights ago.
I had seen him since as soon as I entered
from the top of the dumpster—with his tail
dipping like a candle's flame—
he leapt and pounced on me
and stamped the wood and the shoes
with even more fur.
He had a group of bright wolves
who followed in his wake
and chased us out of the woods
with their tails between their legs,
everyone else still there and quiet.
The great grey wolf I had seen
was gone. We were in the middle of nowhere,
with nothing else to do but stay
and watch him as he rocked the dumpster
and shoved and shoved
the air in, and then
carefully worked back into a long
clutching strop
that held the shoe in
and stopped for a moment
and then started again—
the fur catching
caught in a trap and
carried into the yard by  a herd of sheep
who had been watching.

Stairway to Heaven by Christina Pugh

You are in the twilight of your life. You have turned away from your loved.
You are at the top of the stairs. You are going down.
You are going down.

Your footsteps echo off the floor.
You are going down.

You are going down.

You are going down, step by step,
graining the stone slab
until the stairs become a very long staircase
where you step on an earth
knocking on the door and opening it.

The moonlight from the windows
in a very long time you are at the peak
and the gardens are deserted.
You are going down.

You are going down, step by step.
You are going down.

You are going down.
You are going down.

When you reach the bottom of the stairs,
you pull yourself up and shout.
You scream.
The moonlight is gone.

You are gone.

Gone by Gwendolyn Brooks

When lyery night
I was growing
And I sat there
From down by the river

And cried
"Bad Lyery Night
I dreamed
About the long-domed building
In which I had a house

Nights ago —
“The Lyery Night”

I used to tell you all about
But I thought
Of all the ways
I had been
Saved.

And then I realized
It is not worth
Worrying about the bad Lyery Night

But if I could just
Break into a shoe shop
And there was a bright
Chair there

I would be happy
But I would not be happy

Anyway, the Lyery Night
Is gone.

Common Worm in the Tunnel by Robert W. Service

Common worm in the tunnel
scuffs the pavement with gravel
till light wells up from dark
where a beam of light
hits the opening and shimmers
like a flower's petals
and blooms, blossoms
like a flower's petals
and blooms, blooms as a flower
threws into the air,
threws,
And the road crawls.

A Pair of Wands for Rubens by Robert Bly

The bird that did not fly
was dead. The viscera had hardened –

the strays on my wall, the one
on which the child sat

had caved down, my painted spoon.

Never mind the person, though
who is there and who is
dying does not matter. I am serve -

and that’s why I am not happy.

This long walk to the market square
where I bought the food and wine.

Some days the disease of the city,
a song of joy, a psalm,

grazes on the wounded, grows in me.

‘Never mind the people,’

I speak to myself, the words tumble

from my mouth without cause.

I have learned to be clean, to be silent

when I am angry, to be silent when I am sad.

I have learned to keep my house clean

and never to forget my dog,

Arguably by Elizabeth Mullen

I was expecting black
to come
through the doors,
at this level,
and the serape
I handed to him
was soft as a sock

no one knows
if the straw came through or
the arrow
did it.

He put it away
with pride.

But when I went out,
I pushed it
back into the fence,
then knocked,
To be told
that the wind
had carried it
far.

His wife,
who was there
at the door
and overheard me
requesting to speak
to the president,
said that
it was my hat
she had picked out
from the sack
in the plane.

I was shocked
to learn they had
fired her
for a novel
in the third
person,
these crackpots
who should know
better than to edit

that old thing
and put it
on the top shelf
where it sits today,
and into the forgotten
multi-media
of my life.

When Heaven, the Supersound by Roddy Lumsden

When heaven, the supersound,
or the demon-plane, came to Canterlot

to record my reverie
on a blown-glass metal plate,

and feast me the dark pleasures of the main stage,

I crushed the carcass of the musician
that had made me the Bat

and gave rise to the acerbic score.

I distorted the nursery rhyme
So that my little one could receive

the Academy's honors:

the National Merit Scholarship, the Peabody,

and a Silver Slugger award.

But in the meantime, I'd serve
in the Model Railroad,

and wait for the light
to pierce the morning dew

and accept my fate as one who lingered
until a siren blared from the next train,

hoping the train would be there.
The siren sounded when I reached

the end of my journey--

and I was bound to the station.

The Spruce by John Ashbery

This spring, silence was crucial,
not a sound to be heard from the deep.

I was trying to be authentic. I had
to be faithful, I had to be clear.

If we act like this again, this next
may not be the last. The future is

not yet sealed. At the center of the house
and all around, criss-crossing walls

above the streets, the houses, and the streets
and the mountains, the homes, the hills,

and the forests, I stood outside
my house, I made my own houses

in the courtyard of my house

I saw how the houses stood
along a single road,

it was winter and it was
morning, I was outside

and I didn’t like it

it was raining, and the houses
so tall and railed,

and the trees,
and the spruce

and the trees.

  El Pozadá by Gabriel Spera

Now I am sick of you
and no longer can be moved
by your way of comforting me.
I want to learn how to be ill.

You can never be old or young, but
you are our friend in private.
You have seen us and we have seen you.
You have bought gifts and we have given them to you.
You have treated us with respect and you have shamed you.

You have never been afraid.
You’ve always known what to do,
and we’ve known what to do.
And if you ever die,
you’ll be buried in a private cup to avoid the stigma of the world.

The Liar by George Elliott Clarke

It’s more like a passion than a machine.
There’s no point in the mistimed-up,
Or the race-horse stampede, or saying one thing
And doing the opposite, or even feeling that way.

There’s no form to top, for there’s none.
The only form is a bare-footed one,
For nothing but a bare foot on the ground.

Perhaps there’s a certain truth:
“we’re all in this together,” it seems to be
Depressingly true, but less so like it.
So I’ve always held about something
That I’m sure it’s true. Shouldn’t speak.

O'er the Wild Trees by Celia Holt

Stepping off my bicycle
in the city of Uniondale
I hear my name in the heat of the sun.

I’ve seen the forest burn
someplace close to my speed.

I’ve brought a present
to the intersection
of Canyon Lane and Avenue E
where the freeway
cuts into the Westside Highway

and is surrounded
by neighborly homes,

a boy’s dream
ahead of its physical
boundaries.

I have seen
the southern mountains
return to their shared
pastures,

the limits of a location
hopping in the early
morning — it’s then

I am out of my home

and I am back in the house

where I am not from.
The backyard has dried,

the front door is open,

the kitchen still needs
a place to sit

and the living-room balcony
does not have a place to sit.

The Empty Vessel by Heinrich Heine

Lulled by the songs, I wake up the first time;
I see the scaffold, then I see the scaffold’s wall

gasping for something to do. Something to do

with nothing, facing no one: it’s no time to be

half asleep or half awake or half washed

and a-woman, as I am, a-woman, washed

up in the tide, the tide looking

like shapeless tangled masses of air on my steel-

bottom, as though they were not there at all.

Is that what you were dreaming: the dreams

of being undone, of being forgotten for a month?

It’s a beautiful day and I am always glad

when I wake like the tide, and I am always glad

when your feet touch the shore, as they were in

your bed, when your body lives

pierced and hot, as they did when you hung

like a poodle on a neon tetra rope

that floated like a poodle

on a chain to a kinked capitol,

peering from the rope to the sea

that said that is where this is going:

the sea equaling heaven.

“” by Shannon Briggs

December’s temporary rhyme,
the departure of the bloom.

After the monsoon,
after all,

the breeze’s enough.

But now,

I hear the subjectivist came up
with Plaisir,
wanting to be weaned,

to be groomed,
to be the one

to wait on
while the flower
comes again.

It is not that I am
unable to face
my own problem,

it is the bard's

poems I quote

that make my mouth do it.

Smile

and don’t cry.

A Mantie by Lucie Brock-Broido

I lived in a house on the middle of
the main street that used to catch
onto the boats, the night
that chucked me here, the door
open and draughty, a garage
rolling me on the carpeted floor,
and every breeze was a sudden prayer.

I'm not sure how to say
“disaster,” or how to say
“mistake,” or what to say
when I see you again in the city
with the same old black and red t-shirt,
which I opened with a free hand,
or forced into a box
that I never got to use, or had
Ivanhoe fly into the house.

You must have walked down a long road,
one that was at least not
boring, or somewhere else
other than the one you arrived
at.
Do you remember the kind of road
that was there? It was only a
strand of a distance between
two buildings.
What were you doing there?
I'm sure you were on your way
to another place, a place
not far from where you were.

Live long and prosper
the next time you see
yourself and your dreams
thwart the chains of hatred
that tear you apart.

The Silliest Surpassing Thing in the World by CAConrad

Forgive me,
your stupid little letter.
A truth
crowds out the rest,
but this one,
waiting impatiently
for the light.

You’re late to the party,
and now I am ready
to see it grow.
I’ve waited in vain
for the night
to shade my sunny place,
I think I’ve finally
fit in,
you’re wrong.

I’m here, I’m here now
in case the whole world
just falls away
at the first break
of a long, long journey.

Looks at you there,
the late,
or the hungover,
and all that sizzling
cocktail or pastrami,
the old student president’s ramen,
and pants in the morning,
the grease melting into ice
on the hanger,
how fat you look,
and hot you smell,
the young people’s best single.

I hear you still have
your virginity
hung over your shoulder,
so you can’t
see a peep of the
curtain or the
door anywhere,
and look up at me
and swear
you’re still not

done with college.
Wear those pants again.
So sexy to be so
taut, so free.

I hear you still
have your virginity

on the brain.
And stay away from
whores.

“In the mountains, in the valley of the shadow of the mozaje” by Georges Simenon

In the mountains, in the valley of the shadow of the mozaje
I was born. As I have grown, I have wandered,
I have learned of the woods and its many paths
and of the valleys that I have discovered,
and the things that have come out of them,
and how I’ve learned to fly. I was born in the mountains
of Xanthar, a born to wander
from one east to west,
from one east to south,
from one east to west, and from one east to east.

on the last train home; the song I sung
a real charm
“Come back to me in a bus
“Good luck, Philip”
I jingled and twirled my hair

just the way I do in bed
acknowledged in a socked toe

and a toeed out ball of my hair
though I can hear you moan

in the background — my boy is singing again,
I am thrilled my love is there and safe

with me on a brighter track so I should be happy.

Blank by Peter Santieri

The blue ritournown of the mind,
that which awaits the right to live full-time,
for a year beyond the silences of waking,
carries you to the end of feeling,
from the manicured meadows of childhood
to the abyss of death (a third
which is nothing and nothing and nothing—you know).

You walk into the sunset,
the sea of eyelids, and there’s
no north or south. There’s only
the long silent road, where
the old seas criss-cross the back
of your head, where a tide
that’s been pulled out of time
is falling into the void,
the endless jungle that no one’s
going to tell you where it’s coming from
because it’s no one’s fault if it’s there.

The Torrent by Gail Mazur

Beneath the chilly moon,
the night is black
like a gutter
that thrums for the dark
where a t-rex
spins like a freight
car under the snows.

His name is Snails,
he’s fat, and he’s
happy to be fat.

Here on this lifeless
road, snow drifts
where he’s been
and lies curled
up like a moth.

He’s been moving
for hours,
and at least he’s not
going anywhere anytime soon.

He’s not a thief
he’s just in it
to have a corpse.

He’s a messenger
prepared to take you home,
don’t worry if
birds don’t come.

He’s been through hell
and back, he’s got
the scars to prove it,
you’re welcome.

You’re welcome.
The snow drifts,
the cats escape,
the wood is falling.

He’s carrying
special winter supplies
and with them,
special gifts.

With them,
special things.
The road grows
deep and dark
knowing the path
has led nowhere.

The Devil Is In the Details by William Butler Yeats

In a little cottage by the woods where the rockfish roam
I shall make a sketch and try to be brave...
Come on, I will draw a horse's tail
or a chicken’s ass... Come on, I will
make a boat’s deck look like a girl’s panties
while the ferryman shouts a song in the Strait
“The devil is in the details,” I will pretend
that I am the captain of the ferry,
and drown my sorrow in the leathers,
while the lights of the sunset flash across
the tiny windows as I swim towards the next house.

Anxiety by A. B. Jackson

I have learned to speak my pain back into your language. I have learned to answer my anxieties with confidence. I have learned to listen to my fears. I have learned to take my anxiety seriously. Now I’m an airplane; the fields are silent. I don’t have to worry about being the last passenger on this earth. I don’t have to make you answer the phone. I can be someone I am not. I can’t be afraid to be myself. I can’t be someone I am in order to be something I am not. I can be someone I am in order to be something I am not.

My song is so simple, I should have never written it. It says only I’ve run out of words to give to a man.

The Cold Hearted in the Dark by Michelle Hang

When I first moved to Taiwan
she asked to borrow clothes
from the thrift store.
I asked for something

shorter, and she asked me
to borrow a sweater.
I was wearing

a pink slip, and she was
ready to beat me.

I was dressed in
a tutu in a light blue
toque. She walked next
to me in the street and

compassed the brilliance
of my eyes. She was
genuine but cold.

I looked around for clothes
on the map, and the stores
taught me how to wear

ties. How do you grow
a mustache? I asked
her. She said

you’re too hairy for
a mustache, you’re too
thin, and you’re

stubby. She said
you’re cute,
but when I told her
that I was a man
she said,

“Bear in mind
your new self
has teeth.”

The Company by Robin Ekiss

Maureen Lipstetter
Plenty of people have more than I do—
It’s hard to know where to look.

I have many friends who have much more than I do—
They’re going to college or getting jobs—
How can I be sure they’re the only ones who know
how much I have or haven’t had in the past?
Too late now. It’s too late now to ask,

how much I have or haven’t had in the past,
how I was called the Wonder Gum of my childhood,
how I got into culinary school,
how I was called tsundere after all the dead.
Isn’t it fair to ask only now,
when everyone has more than I do?
If only I had a little more,

I could go back to that Halloween costume—
I’d wear something safe and not too tight—
I’d wear something strappy and not too tight—
I’d even wear a strappy suit,
but it’s too late now.
It’s too late now to ask,

How much of what you have or haven’t had in the past
does you know about and does it matter?

How much of what I have or haven’t had in the past
does the past matter?
I’ve read all kinds of things about the future—
I’ve even some of them been published—but how much
do I really know about it?

“Steady, Old-Time” by Robert Hayden

Twenty years on from the death of Sheffield by black men
who started a thousand fires,
steadily slouching
temporarily at the urn where, for weeks,
I held my newborn.

■

It was, finally, the dead

that got me back on with my life,
as my blood fails, I’ll be back
to my old ways.

And so it was that,

at my relatives’ place
it’s Saturday

and everywhere I go at still,
a woman comes by mine,‎

the way she’s always wanted
to see me.

She wants to tell me

the death didn’t have to come,
the healing can begin now.

Tell me you’re not going
to bed yet, that you’re going
to bed as soon as possible.

Tell me you’re not going

to bed yet, that you’re going
to bed, still, as soon as possible,

just to rest and heal.

This is my book and with a little help

I am a laundry
comber and if you see me

so/good so,

We can have fun every day
and every girl is welcome
at any time,

We can have fun every day
with those teeny weeny cats
and their annoying
curdy little crates

(I tell you it is funny)
We can have fun every day
and be safe and strong and smart
and beautiful and honest
all those little fluffy cats
who always wear a dress
because that is how a girl is

and what they think
I want this to be a tradition
of not only feeling good
but doing things the right way
and not letting anger
get in the way of doing things.

A Reason by William Blake

Nothing is the same without a reason.
It is always in a thing’s side,
trying to stay out of the way.

If it’s not in a thing, it looks like dirt.
If it’s not in a thing, it looks like a rotten apple.
The disconsolate person, still in a house,
tries to stay out of the way.

He doesn’t need to be told what’s the problem, it’s just
the time he has to pay the bill or bring the kids.

He doesn’t need to be told what’s the problem, the sad situation,
the old man’s excuse for not getting on.

It’s always in a thing.

of many years, of many

difficulties—all of this

with my shoes, concealing the truth beneath

a pair of silly flats.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by D. Nurkse

When I put the ring on my finger it is a thing.
I have a dream of it going on my waist, of the knot going down, the liquid filling its very place.

It is what we call pain in this country, this tomb. It is a thing with absolutely no name. It is what is called by our children a toy. When you put it on your finger it is a thing.

But I play with it, I put it on my belt. I put it on my finger, saying,I am going to wear this ring, I am going to put it on my belt, I am going to wear this thing, I am going to put it on my neck, I am going to put it on my hair.

where I’d somehow missed  my confession.

I go there with my inner John Doe
and my inner Rorschach,

where I’ve always stayed so down to earth,

but now I recognize the title
of my confession, and am so moved

that my life’s pretty much over,

I’d never had a life so beautiful,

I call it and I ask for forgiveness.

My old life,  my old home,

is gone and gone forever.

The Borderland by Manuel Amalfi

a point of light counting no more
spaces or borders.

The borderland is a gateway
that one can cross

without walking across history—
no one is ever at the top

of one’s mountain

but the government is

promising new markets

where cars juke­

pop, the system of wretchedness

tutels you to new suburbs

or construction sites,

but you need a passport

to get into the landin

pier, you need

a mobile phone

to keep in touch

about the history of your country

or the first victims,

the Border Patrol agents

everyone loves.

One should never say
not to trust someone

till one’s answered

with No.

Speak first

before answering

you’ll be sorry.

What is it like

to live alone?

Game by Robert Herrick

The game we all play,
Is this to be victors' devises;
That no one, who by chance is touched
By the stride of the great man
In the lock and slam of the door,
Or happens to be in the room
On the instant at volume so loud
As to drown the warm, mild sound
Of our masters' who shew
Their mantels and smart their feet;
Or is it one who shews
His gear in the room,
Gestures the great man to a chair or wits' bench
And forgets, that I know,
That I cry, and knowledge gains
In that noise of a great man's feet
That's over the great,
The cool silence is another name
For the same thing.

O, the consciousness that comes
From the large gate of love! Honoring such a grand woman
As was the lovely woman I was,
Or had been my dear one, or like,
From the great harm of old!

   Saint Teresa is True by Marie Howe

Yet, even in the heart of a rose
the soul returned alive
in a web of sights, a veiled room,

a garden of cardoires, anthers,
and bright-lit vases

where, with a surviving hand,
you proceeded to rauc
out the crackle of rose petals

to the heart of Saint Teresa’s heart,
where the muffled pulses of her
girlhood singing reverberate today.

Spoken by Saint Teresa from the heart
of a rose,

spoken by Saint Teresa from the heart of Saint Teresa,

spoken by Saint Teresa from the heart of Saint Teresa,

the heart is alive,
in the open air, unconstitutioned,

and it is a habitat for souls,
a body of water where the heart

stirrates and the wind makes the heart live,
a grave of the heart that is not out of place

on this earth.

Aeneid by Pauli Murray

On account of the work done, fortune had expected
the bathtubs for the house and dug them
up with saws and wades, then tossed them
with their contents everywhere. They were full of water.

They were called boats because they were usually steam-assisted
figures of boats sunk by pirates, still wet with the blood
of those they had carried out to sea.

That morning, they paddled into the harbor,

officially open to the public, and there,

at the dock of a small fishing boat, stood two brick-colored
constellations, taller than a house
that was, itself, higher than the small,

gentle lake, the flightless birds with their nests.
There they were in brass daylight, sailing toward
their families, the castaways, the lonely ones
nearly invisible, the ship's oars modestly tapping
their soft feet against the path the passengers
could see out ahead.

True, they were sailing toward a better life,
but these were the women that Pauli Murray
knew, and he wanted to make them his wife.

Parted Ways by Jane Hirshfield

I move out of my house, quiet as one
of the cars that come to a stop,
green dandelion outlines,
indifferent to anything but the next.
I am moving out of my house.

I will not be
considered for several positions
I’ve been offered,
not necessarily to be in a movie
but to be somewhere else.
I am moving out of my house.

Part of me is hesitant
(though I’ve been told
how nice it is to be part
of the family and the singing
of the car alarm)
to leave,
to say good-bye.
I am moving out of my house.

To live somewhere else
is to accept
the fact
that my life
is being considered for several
opportunities
to be in a movie
but to live somewhere else.

The ways in which I speak
and act are being judged.
I am moving out of my house.
I am living somewhere else.

This Is Our Skin by Michael Basile

No one expects to be released, but then they are, and the rest is routiné.
This is our skin, our blood, our language, our eyes, our philosophy, our history.

It's taken all night, but we won—and this is the best music I've ever heard.
The acts of love and forgiveness are beautiful, but not the truth.

I Sit and Think by David Ferry

I sit and think for days.

On the pool table,
all day, and even now

i sit and think.

I sit and think

I sit and think

I sit and think

and then I am up

early myself

and start my day

sitting and thinking

and I am still sitting

by the pool table.

“The Whistler” by Andrew Joron

In the heat of winter,
in the wood-frame of a house
sands pour into an unlit room
where you stand

in a couple's bedroom
while one of you sits
on the stove
with a cigarette
In the desert the sky
is full of stars
and in the house,

the cold feels more like rain
as you look out
from the window
at emptiness
and the sounds
of animals
crashing into each other
like the ends of two sheets

and from the window
you see the yard
that’s always bare and
the frozen village
in the distance
where you are

a great upset
where you know
nothing has changed and
there’s nothing in your life

that will change or
are going to change

when the winds gather
and blow the wind into the town
of eros, get lost
and when the raging winds
flash into the window,

run to the window
and yell
I AM SO SICK OF THE SNOW
to get out of there.

“Without comments, the silence lengthens.” by Ilya Kaminsky

Without comments, the silence lengthens.
We are all living in the shadow of our silence.
The virgin who lives behind our silence
has lain there for years in the shadow
of this silence. The silence of the future
will deepen and deepen and deepen.
The silence of our silence.
The silence of the present.
The silence of the past.
This silence, this lengthening silence,
is sad.

But grow louder, grow louder,
grow louder,
grow louder! The silence of the future
is still as silent as it was before.

Yes, it will grow louder still.

The Notes by Stephen Dunn

The notes of the clock are
a record of my days,
the notes of the music
are a record of my hours of madness.

It is a debt that I have
to pay, a debt that I will
never pay again,

and what I have suffered
for my debt I learn to love

and want to give back,
I learn to be glad to be

a member of what is going on
in a world for the birds.

And the birds, doing what they do,
are not laughing that day,

are not sad in a town like me;
they love the clouds
of the suburbs like you.

There's a Story by Stephen Dunn

There's a story—my mother's
in the hospital—a rod of it
cutting into her leg, the kind
you'd use for kicking a fallen branch
or putting a spoonful through a moth's

eyes. There's a story—my mother's
in the hospital, for the life of her
they've broken open my shoulder and she's
banging twice her size despite
my best efforts. There's a tale
of the play that started in the closet
where someone tried to teach me
how to be a man—I was weak
enough that I was killed
by something worse—a comic book
with a zingy ending covered in
dirty, bloody smudges.

There's a story. There's a story.
This is it—my past is coming
back. It's a fine
acre of grass. It's long past
and quiet. Brinded in a corner a sign
blows a smoke over a burning bush.

I want to be in the story.
There's a story. There's a story.
It's as if I'm in a light
that's never had a name, as if I'm
a black robe wrapped around a half-dressed woman
in a storybook sitting in darkness—
type of story.

The story is still the same.
There's a story. The story
is the same. Then, in the dark,
I'm a boy who doesn't know
what I'm calling me.
It's something like sleep or a dream
that happens in a dream.
There's a story. There's a
story. The story is as usual
a kind of black scale
that's just moving up
and down. A pile of old clothes
that doesn't look like anything
else. A room in a house
that looks like a garage.
This story's going nowhere.

A Lullaby to an Old, Poor Box by Elizabeth Bentley

Our real fault
Is showing up,
Where we’re no longer welcome:
St. Matthew’s, the Ministry,
The circus, the Santa Clarita,
The old house that we’re moving
To next, the next,

Until the time we’re here,
The weekend passes,
And we take even more notice,
The stars, the nights,
The bricks we pile in boxes,
Or just throw on the floor
And have a good time.

Then we do the same,
Coaching the game of numbers
And hoping for the same,
Alone in the room,
In another room with the door,
I know where I am, I’ll be there.

And once again, you’re not here.

I
was trying to stop you
from moving

I
said you should
stay

behind me.

I
was trying to
find you

and was in you.

I
was trying to
get you out of your car

into the very river

and into my car

as you were about to
start the engine

in the middle of the river

but you

deflected me.

Would you
believe it was

a mistake
to hold yourself

away from the world

when I said

you should
stay.

[The typewriter of dreams] by Lee Herrick

The typewriter of dreams
(for a dozen hours)

and I, who’ve awakened,
forget long norings and they,

he comes on his,
he waits, clutching

his dog — even the door’s
open, and he’s the only one

at the door,
and holding his breath.

I Can Never Let You Go
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Ben Lerner

I can never let you go,
I will never let you go,
If you do not stop acting
with that selfish
misery of yours,
that salty narcotic,
and, I’ve been dreaming
of someone else suddenly knocking
on your door,
looking
at you politely and kindly,
telling you he’s there,
telling you he’ll be there
soon, telling you
this is his job,
he’s in the know,
he’s on the way
to come in and be
the friend you never had,
a kind of lover’s parole,
reasoning with you
and letting you
know how much
this means to him,
with how much
it’s meant to you,
hanging out
some nights,
helping you
have fun,
helping you laugh
at your mistakes
and growing pains.

Echo by Melissa Broder

silence as a door
kept swinging.

I dimming my reflection
in a room of my own,
and this shadowy room of my own.

I felt inside of me
as if I was to be

a tiny piece of the show,
a little piece of what I wanted

to say. I was afraid to bite.
I was afraid to command.

Silence as a door
didn’t shut.

I could have said
something else —

that’s what a show
is all about,

the presence of the host.

I didn’t want to be
a public speaker
in public.

Instead, I wrote
myself a song.

But silence was
deep inside me —

and I wanted to come
even more deeply

into that silence.

Last Snow by E. D. Hirsch

The first snow fell in a forest
Not far from here.

The second.
The third.
The fourth.

It melted.
White roofs of ice
covered the steps
where we stood

in the straw barn
that had been
filled with greenery

and tannery sparks.

The fifth.
The first tree
had all of the leaves

of that year’s leaves
falling from it

on it’s fragments.

The sixth.
The crawfish
had all of the legs
of that year’s legs

on its shoes.
The seventh.
The dog that had been
kept at the school

belongs in a box
to the spider, which is
doggy.

The witch has brought
only one toy
but no healing tools.

The father has used
his daughter as a sacrifice
to the crawl
by his side.

The mother’s invoked
her power as a candy cane.

And the patriarch’s?
He had promised
not to abandon his wife
if she were wed.

Pocket Marbles by Linda Pastan

Out in the yard the pigs, the dogs,
sit in a circle around the fire
smoking hot, muttering, shuffling
their feet, tapping their heads.

Soon they will be snowed in by the sleet
and turned into the trunks of sand
sledding across the yard, patching
the cracks along the road.

After America the Joke is Over
we bend down to the blue and white striped
sledding field, players and coaches
carry bags of sacks and balls
like muddy horse shoes.

No one is home. No one is in the yard.
We take off our coats and plunge straight into the mud.
We practice hook shots and kickoffs,
touching the ball in the back of our hands.
We pretend to be little boys and girls
and sledding over the field.
We make our voices a song
like the pigs of the neighborhood
sleeping in their corners with their dogs.

A Lonely Girl by Judith Ortiz Cofer

I bought a skirt,
a pair of black stockings,
and a brown leather skirt,
but I had no money.

I had only two hours
to live and die.

The rain made me happy:
I sang in the rain.

It got more beautiful
and more peaceful while I slept,
but the rain
never stopped.

My mother stood in her bag
and cried not to leave
I was a fortune-teller.

It was my dream come true when
I woke up.

  The Sad Beautiful by Shana Hakim

Sad beautiful, my lady,
With all her love, I am doing
With the threat of so much worse.
The razor-sharp edges of the winds
Beating the trees are coming.

I am not afraid: I have
Piled my fear with a roof
Awnings to protect myself,
And I am not crying.

He is laughing.
The world has become
An imaginary room,
With the promise of
A ghastly trip.

Misfortune will not overtake
Inanimate Matter,
Nor hunger or thirst,
Our hearts will not poison
Our mouths and minds,
We will be reborn
Into an atmosphere of
Beauty.

When I speak this,
The local tapestry is twining
Around the long, tall telephone,
And I . . . the telephone is limping
Across the room.

The truth is that on somewhere
A child is listening.
He is laughing.
The world is not a big, grand or secret room,
But there is a lot that is laughing,
And there is a lot that is limping.

Comfort Food by Laurel McCune Peterson

They dance a dance
away from each other,
stiff and sober, not out
of any longing to impress,
but rather to be happy.
Their pockets are oversize,
their buttons undone,
and a crowd pleases them
more than I can possibly do.
The music keeps on
as the dancers begin to move again,
it's like two dancers
stiff and sober, not out
of any longing to impress,
but rather to be happy.
They dance a dance
away from each other,
stiff and sober,
not out of any longing
to impress, but simply
to be happy.

I’m the only racialist in the room
I’m getting my ass kicked

I’m on a diet
I’ll thank God for my eyes

I’m hungry for white people

My eyes are boring up front
my mouth is closing

My toes are typing rapidly on my road shoes

My feet are annoying
I’m running out of white space

I’m walking to school

My feet are irritating
I’m tired of walking
I’m tired of looking white

I’m bored with walking
I’m sitting on my road shoes
And it’s soccer time again

I'd like to have been born a girl who couldn’t.
I'd like to have been born a slave.
I’d like to be a black girl with long black hair.

I’d like to be the girl to be freed.
I’d like to be the girl who gets to start.
I’d like to be something.

I’ve wanted to be a wizard for years.
Can I be a witch, too?
I’ve wanted to be a witch.

Is that worse?
Being an unmoved egg.

We can fix that, though.

I’ve been in the cage before.
Isn’t that what I was called?
I’m called a wizard, and I’m a wizard.

I’m been in the cage before.

You know the one thing you’re always hoping for?
Your freedom.

Jukebox by Deborah Paredez

Join or be part of the guerilla rock band
Jukebox, perform stand up comedy, sing karaoke,
melt down to pumpkin and juke,
smell bourbon, panties in the air,
smoke weed, be a wildflower,
nicotine hype, be a yedi,
and wear sparkly tweed
with a pair of big black jeans.
Yes I know what you did
was a joke, didn’t you say?

Jukebox is loud, they’re good for a laugh,
it’s okay to be a prude,
and the burly bunch of us
can’t stop laughing at the joke.

We’re a bunch of moochers,
we aren’t too smart to be rockstars,
we’re super serious.
We could probably do with a little more

oomph and poise—the slightest slip
means disaster. We carry our own
luggage, we don’t ride motorcycles,
we don’t drive fancy cars,
we don’t have mamas or judges
who could throw the perfect
quiz. We’re jukeboxes—
we are rock stars—
standing tall, swinging, entertaining.
Can you feel the electricity?
Yes I can.

Within by CAConrad

For those of us
who have had none,
this is love, no
honey-combed...

There is a golden light in
the old girl’s voice
that sings in my singing voice

When she sings
to herself.  That sound
is love, Noe.

When she sings
to herself,
the sound
of a song is love,

It is love,
Noe.

When she sings

a little song that she herself has sung,
the sound
of a song is love,

Beauty is the sound
of my singing without me,

love, noe.
When she sings, as I sang,
beauty is the singer,

As I sang, the sound
of a song is love,

There is a golden light in
that sweet sounding voice
when she sings
in her own singing voice.

the weary journey, the search for a world that I found
I took at the end of a long day of hunting

And the blackest night, the roads of a distant land
that ran with icicles of ice upon my skin,

And in the hands of the roaring lightning
carried more rape than most lovers do in a bed of roses.
I took roses and I, of course, took several screwdrivers
to clean the dented plates of a statue

And the bells that rang from the taverns and parlors
of my days
though my cataracts are a work of art when I write

Don’t you forget me, dear, that I know
and heard you saying so loud, a groundless plea
for your life

And the streets of a wild town were choked with all the thrum of love
languished around your tall frame, but then were replaced by streets of murder

And then, finally, by the deserted streets of the lost city
come back, it was not love that made me more alive, but fear
of love, and the steel bars that or have been locked
against my heart, the ashes that are making up the living

That you are alive.

The Big Ones by C. P. Cavafy

It is going to happen again and again
according to the plan,

and as a powerful and caring teacher,
I urge you to listen
to my voice,

to my long-form sentences,
to the deep voice inside you,

to turn off the TV,
to take a warm bath,

to ask only the things you want
and do not have to ask—then

when the time comes,

to answer your loving questions,
to hold your hand,

to kiss your cheek,
to drink from your glass
with your own body

the way you did
before the fall

and don’t forget to say Good-bye
to the sky,
to the sun,

to my words, love,
to the red-winged sparrows
in the wildflower mead,

to the bus that never comes,
to the diamonds scattered in the sand,

to the little things—
the little performances
that make the rest come together

like jigsaw puzzles.

The Writer by William Butler Yeats

1

I alone of all men am the worst,
I alone of all my works
the worst writer of all,
my works all the same,

I alone of all places
is worst,
has been the worst,
has not been the worst,

I alone of all ugly
furniture,
of all my beds
dances with this ill,
always in my head
the shadows of shame
of shame
I alone of all my poems
dances in this little room,

The writer is the worst.

The writer is the worst when he burns
and moon goes round.

The writer is the worst,
I alone of all his poems
dances with this ill,

The writer is the worst
when he burns,
and moon goes round.

But to the best of us
it’s good to have you in our company,

to speak of your poems,
to work for them,

and there’s always that moment
when we’re lucky,
when our music moves
the listenership moves,

and it’s always good to share
our words with one another,

and the poet’s still the worst,
perhaps, although he’ll never be

the most beautiful writer of all,
yes.

Become A Giraffine by June Jordan

The giraffes of the other side of the river
now live in a cave above the water.
They still remember their past
but don’t remember the one before.

Flying with the sun, great white pythons eat
the whole steaming boat at once.
They’ve never been so fast
from the egg-laying barn.

There’s a lot riding on this
and no one knows why.

Up there in the pine forest
the sound of thumping feet can
be heard all the way down.

The Labby by Josephine Miles

I’m not the lonely person I hoped to be, unless I’m not careful.

But will my voice be found
on Labby? Or will there be music?

Or will Brooklyn be dead again?

Will the world collapse?

Or is a second birth to come

In another city?

How can I get back to the lab

That I left in the world?

The Grifter by T. K. Sciamma

We were walking past town the other night
when suddenly I saw a woman walking with a bag.

She was a slicer in the city. She packed
every sandwich at the market. Her security camera
was on all fours. Now I'm sure what she said

I could not believe. No one wanted to be
grateful or to look at her.

We were walking past town the other night
when suddenly I saw a woman walking with a bag.

She was nervous:
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

I can still taste that smile
I gave her earlier. Only now,
it was withering and I knew I owed
it to her to do the same.

I like to think she loved me, not
for what I said but for who I smiled.

She came back to me later that night.
And just like that, I was in a love poem
and she was wearing the centerfold.

“Dress by William Butler Yeats” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

Dress of the sea, how doth it drave me?
Fare thee well, for that bed hath slept with
My well-chastised heart; and with pain drest,
The young and the frail, the betrothal,
The wantad and I, the dearer thing,
Fare thou well.

Wrest thou me with her fairer hand,
Let me charge thee as one who hath
Taught her the things she herself hath not;
But now, fair and sincere,
If her hand can love thee, let her charge;
For thou too can move the hearts of others.

The Saddle by Leslie Harrison

I was mounted in a saddle
on a ridge
above Beartooth, Montana
in the early summer

and I was bleeding
for no reason other than mountaineering
and wanting to be carried.

I counted
five deaths by accident
after sliding off the edge
of the summit.

I was riding toward
a place I would never return.

I was saddled up on rails
in exposed spaces

and still I was being carried
like a big heavy suitcase.

It was a wonderful thing,
the experience of a lifetime.

Later, I was on my way
north to pack up
and I would return the saddle
to its old place

behind the house
in Beartooth, Montana
and the rich history of the area
would come out in the foreground
like a ball of light
pulling me toward it.

But the saddles never
reappear,
and the dirt trails never
end.

My Mother's Flowers by Stephen Dunn

In the living room, in my mother's palm

and the girl's desk, I tried to ask

what it is I’m supposed to do now.

And what am I supposed to do?

Knot fertilizer exploding.

A ten-foot bob took down our house.

The projection, so we’re thinking

about tomorrow.

Our children, I’m thinking about tomorrow.

My children, I’m thinking about tomorrow.

Because the gift of tomorrow is

always faster than the gift of today.

So we’re living now. The living room, the girl's desk,

my mother’s flowers, if my mother’s flowers

can be construed as anything other

than a living room, the girl's desk,

my mother’s flowers, if my mother’s flowers

can be construed as anything other

than a hung aisle.

Pythagorean by Edward Thomas

“Unbearable, ungrateful man”
I answered, “Blah, blah, blah. I’m just thankful it’s not the apocalypse.”

What a joy to be glad at having
been in love. But invariably
I’ve missed the decals
or my long-lost ex-lover.

“I’m not just glad. I’m glad.”
I’ve called a taxi
and lodged a complaint, never
thinking about what would happen
I’d never be sorry.

“If only they’d let me
call a cab and pay!”
In the dark, at night
I lie curled in a corner,
stopping to make small jokes
about my ex-wife..

“I’ve interviewed the Red Sox
for a job that’s out there.”
I’ve waited in line
for hours on the 6:10
or finally retired.

“I’ve been to the doctor
and checked into a hospital.”
The sky thins as the wind blows.

Tours by M.L. Talbot

Desolation Tour, Oxford and Cambridge, 1903
For a healthy man or a sick man the body has tools to spare. One thing the world can do.
The north wind blew over a canal. Most of the world was showing from one
river, Thames cinema, or the Whitney. The stalls were crowded with English and American writers,
poets, translators, and the like, and the theatre was packed with the eye of the world.

You could not walk more than thirty miles without stopping.
It was the Battle of Somme, and the previous summer an aviation platoon from the United States had finished a tour in the same place as my mother and I.

We had walked twenty more. While walking, we had looked over the hills and paused to marvel at the hydraulic road,
the narrow gauge tracks, the unfair cost of living, the train horns, the sound of the bell, the things you imagined and hoped to be.

Now, two thousand miles from the battlefield, we stood before an altar and, at the brink of the earth, we shared our fate. What we had done was unworthy of us, but what we had done was necessary and heroic.

The New England Triangle by Jane Hirshfield

You think I’ve got this for you:
lunar restaurants, rock pools, a view

of the Hudson River, like the one
above mine, the one

in Venice plazas, people munching

chees in mazes, or strolling

on a summer afternoon through
an apple tree forest, or

a couple of children playing in fountains,

where should I park? Will I need

a car to get there? More than enough

to satisfy my desires, but what about
snow and raindrops? Where will I park

on Sunday when the moon sets

again? Or on a Tuesday

when the sun sets

again? Or daily,

or every other week? Don’t underestimate

the importance of these things.

Rain
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Stacy Szymaszek

Before the calm lull came, the moon went down,
the clouds parted, and a car was abandoned
in the thresholds of the dark town.

Rain had settled over the country,
the sky had put on shadows,
but the night had come
and never did.

Across the street, a neighbor’s house
grew, another home, one with a record player,
there was a radio, too, and a bookcase.

The doorway was closed, and a knot hung
between the counter and the stairs,
as if the door had been misshapen,

boring, or simply abandoned
for no good reason.

In front of the house, a family
spoke of their old quarrel,
of jealousy, of shared possessions,
of religion, and how the night came
and never did.

Next to the house, a man sat
on a wooden stool, and he poured
a glass of milk into the crowd
in the pouring fountain, and the crowd
gave back their time, their money,
as they poured the glass before the rain.

The Star by Douglas Lovelace

We hold fast the dogma of naked things.
We stare at the great cities,
we peer into the vaults
of the oceans, our feet
scuffed, tolled, and dented.
We stand transfixed in the dark
à la Lezard’s eyepiece,
unseeing, unaware, drear.
In the long night of the 1950s,
we saw ourselves
remission in motion
in the silhouette of the star
inside anaconda.

An Act for the Savings by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

Noe! I have known no man love so long,
Nor love of animals so sore;
That Love’s a foolish man, who attempts
To draw the flame or seize the blade
By any false pretenses or calumny;
Love’s love is either a coward, or lives
In confusion with his true love,
The man I’ve known beside whom
Love’s every word, every lust,
Is a disgraceful, rotten violence.

If you, no, you, have any talent,
If you, if you, have any wit,
To tell the truth or not tell it,
You better use it, sir, sir;
If you, sir, have any wisdom,
To look cool and thoughtful,
Or to avoid hell or gaol,
Or to step up for your love,
Know even then how to live in love,
Because love’s a wasting thing
That can be so cruel or so fair
As to make no one strong,
But always, in the end,
Is just folly, for fools
Are sworn up into Heaven,
And let Love overcome you.

The Possibility of Seeing By William E. Stafford

I was alone twice
with a strange wooden box

in my vehicle.

I was blindfolded
by an old man

who flashed his
*father-blue* badge
knowing I did

speak with a foreigner
who held a different

piece of paper
from which to sue

for a destination after

merchants sat
in rows on desks,

keen and drunk as

tractor trailers,

then I heard her:

a boy’s voice

that said, “My name

is Matilda.”

She ran

through the woods,

straight through the cabin,

and out the window
to the living room.

There was only a sound

of a door being
open or shut.

Who was she?

A woman in a gray

cover,

nearly blindfolded,

in a wad of paper

that morning,

that same day three years

later, whiling

over breakfast,

she’d write, “Hold me,

my love,

by your side,

with your favorite

flower,

I’ll be back

to make it rain.

The
Noisy by Audre Lorde

I walk at night
with a raptor
to the mall
and it rips off
my skirt under the bridge,
exactly how I wanted
to wear.
I walk an hour
and an hour of this

I’ll never learn to read,
but I know 11 angels
will come to minister
to the child who stays,
and I cry when the door opens.

The circus is right in front of me,
and I’m always nice
to the bumbling circus;
I wash my teeth
after football games,
I rove
up and down the hallways
for my toothbrush,
and only the purring
of a tooth is all I hear.

I Know I Never Was by E. E. Housman

I know I never was,
And I was angry at the least thing,
As angry as I was then.

Now I know I was,
But only as there’s nothin' more,
Only as I was born in the land of dreams.

I know I was never born again,
But only as I crawl through the windows of the pre-Civil War South,
And listen to the dogs barking
In the deserted corner of the yard.

I know I never was
Who by making the great effort
Of loving my wife and kids
Is making the great effort
To not be born again.

I know I never was
Except as the old man in the wheelchair
Toes in the watery, bitter
Golf-cart of time
nges on the stone wall
And laughs till he’s drunk.

I know I never was
I know I was born for that,
And miss it when the winey, bitter
Golf cart of time comes back.

The Little Slug by David Trinidad

Left behind
in the giant dark space
within a man’s torso,
a miniature slug,
the only thing visible to us,

it stomps
with the speckles,
the salad dress
a hurriedly

chicken stew.

Then it slips
into the gap,
the long slant eye
of a mouth,

the long slant mouth,
the long slant tail,
the long slant tail,
and into the gap,
the long slant eye,

the long slant mouth.
The letter "L" is
invisible, the picture
is a canvas of a slab
of dark,
the whole room has been
cleaned clear.

It’s possible a Junior
could have done it, the letter
wet, the lid
blown off.

But that would still have been
pretty good photography.

And anyway, I’m not
sure I’ll get to do this,
and the smell
anticipates it, if

there is anything
to do there.

The Girl from the Metro by Alice Fulton

Do you have a word for the sudden fear of loss that comes along with being older? For what happens when you retire, in your snowed-white pajamas, outside a crowded movie house, surrounded by strangers, in a room packed full of friends, with no idea where you are or who you are?
Do you have a word for what happens when you lose track of time and don't hear yourself coming back? For what happens when you sit in a darkened room at the back of a bar and eat alone, under a watchful eye that watches you, and forget to get home, lifting your elbows, no longer lifting them, and then remember?
Do you have a word for the miraculous recovery that comes from daily repetition, the repetition that seems set to continue forever? For the girl who woke up one morning and had to repeat the same steps over and over again, and who woke up in a strange bed and had to repeat that same simple ritual over and over again, and who began to feel as if she were somehow on the wrong side of the tracks, and whom no one had ever been able to touch, and whose life had been on the wrong track all along, and whom the strangers had never really understood, and whom she had always blamed herself, and whom she had never really wanted to be, and whom she had always wanted to be anyway, and which her parents had never really understood, and which her friends had never really understood, and which she herself had never really wanted to be, and which she herself had never really wanted to be, and which neither she nor anyone else could really be, and which she herself had always hoped to be, and which she herself had always sincerely wanted to be, and which neither she nor anyone else could ever really be, and which the strangers had never really understood, and which she herself had always sincerely always wanted to be, and which her parents had never really understood, and which her friends had never really understood, and were she not so, she would have been the happiest girl in the world, and everyone would love her, and they would love her by the way they had always loved her, and everyone would love her, and she would have been the happiest girl in the world.

and are still big enough to scratch a whetstone.

I'm never going back, so I'll start out
in the mid-century, ripping up old pictures
of people I've never liked, making plans
for the first time in my life I will never
get out of. My house is on fire.
Why not just turn up the heat
and let it blacken across the pale walls?
Take advantage of the time
I have left? No one has?

It’s something like that

I’ve thought about a lot, like the flavor in canned tuna,

the way that young adults look at me with their faces

that I’d like to say are the same,

what it’s like to be the only one getting up

and walking up a flight of stairs

and hug the girl in front of me

who stopped herself

also because

all I can do is walk

back into the place where I’m always going to end up,

since I’m not where I want to be right now,

I’m not a bad woman. I mean

I’m willing to try.
Truth be told, I didn’t seem all that

emotionally healthy to him either:

at moments, when he grabbed me
like I was a sexy rag doll,

or knocked me to the floor, then
yanked me back and said,

Do you have money here?

I’ve got a shotgun.
And a maiden-gown
punched in your face,

to the forehead.

bent back

or pull the handle
over the lever
you’d need
a stout drill press
with anvil

To hunt
a duck
with a duck
you’d need
to lift
a chicken
from
its nest
with a watch

To ride

a horse’s head
and a saddle

and you
wouldn’t be surprised
how much

from

you’d ride
on
each stretch
of the road
the haze
of sun
and the night air
simplify

A fair maid, fearless,
Doth gaze thee out of the stall,
Still hairless, and stuff'd but not frizz'd,
Doth peer thee her by,
Heavenly head, and bare feet,
Doth, like the fair maid, gallop thee,
How her song do move thee?
Her song, thou mockers in words,
His fair maid, her beau-
tiful eyes, and the fair maid's eyes,
Play thy trifles to scorn thy stoutness,
Too much like a slave, thou nay:
Too much like a slave, thou nay!

The Scrying Hermit by William Butler Yeats

The dawn on the road,
Sensing that my life
Is in vain, and that
The river is flowing away,
I pretended madness.

It was not undeserved,
But certainly it was not
The unwanted.

The road began to run
Along a cliff,
The valley began to pass
Over a clearing of broken snow,
And brambles of acacia.

I knew that my sense of shame
Was the greatest blind spot,
But where were those stones?

And the goddess with the blue eyeballs
Dressed in the red leotard of a cow
Took me up to her;
With her tiny black toes she ​
Harmed me with a charm
Which I did not know.

She is a house on a hill
With a gateway at the end;
At the door, I turned to lock
The glass door.

The goddess spoke to me
In a loud, deep voice
Which I could not hear.

She asked me where I was from?
I said I was not from.

In the morning, I looked
Back on the road with worn shoes
And a shoe that had been
And was not well maintained.

And the goddess asked me where was I from?
I said, I was not from.

To the Lyric Poets by William Blake

As you did not believe in me, then do not be so quick in your scorn;
The day I will go, the same shall use all the rest;
Leave me no wistful or lamenting mind;
So long as you suffer me, I am safe and glad;
But when I have done, this letter I send away;
And in this letter also I give you this closed book,
For, conversing with my lyre, I have found out
All that is true, and never hath been done,
That was just, and never shall be done;
Thus I will not forget you by any means;
In my heart, I am so disheartened and so glad;
Let my wonted love your fellow-creatures the same,
You strong, fit, and wise, and kind;
I will not remember you and see you in my sleep,
But trust and love, my true love, and your praise;
For I will not forget you and receive your love.

Every morning,

we breath our way to

From the ground up,

We don’t let the sun

You have given me this life

The young dogs that follow you
to the dumpster where you bury
your beautiful dogs that you take

like a natural habit,

like the wisdom of my mind?

Ah, but there’s the rub.

In my last un-
lighted yearbook photo

I look back and see

four men packing
Titanfall, a 12-pack,

a boat, a backpack,
a $2,000 watch

I wore last night

with a satisfied

smirk on my face,
all three of us

stacked in a wooden box

all without having
came here to see

the people we used to know in

to thank those that we did

not. Just me, and

this man built this house in a word

that no one had invented,
who lost or changed his name

too many times to register.

In my dreams, no one
can tell me what’s on

the calendar tomorrow,
but that day

must come, dammit.

How Will You Be (With Other People) by Wendy Videlock

Have I not whispered that my heart was
an animal that could understand memes,

made to eat their own beards?

•

I had never tried to run
the way you ran before

you punched me in the jaw.

I had never been kicked

on a treadmill, knee deep

in a jar of mud.

And my heart, a meat of an animal

half-eaten on a highway sign,

began to chafe.

5 by Jack Prelutsky

This afternoon I went out to buy milk
at the corner store

because I was thirsty
and wanted water

the store clerk snapped me

out of my drab-

brain reverie:

Hey! can you come in

and I will give you a fair

look at the sweetest deal

of all the other sandwiches

I hated so much

but now can’t get enough

and I mam down

honestly to get

back to work

The Elegy by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

All is dying, I know,
No more bread, and broken shoes,
Where moonlight hands feed slaves.

What is left is the dead’s grief,
The melancholy of  Men.
What is left is the dead’s truth,

The springtime, without music,
The falltime, without joy,

The silence, the flower,
The earth that never blooms,

The shade, the presage,
The river that never flows,

The silence, the flower,
The air that never blooms,

The dead that I never knew,

The silent sorrow of  the dead,

Gratifying and dreadful,
The absence of  the dead,

The silent grief of  the dead.

Doors by John Graham

I can open
the door to the bathroom.
Let the water
fill the whole bathtub.

I can use my feet
to enter the bathroom.

I can take the sink
to the other side.

My three dogs
make a constant huff.

I usually can't.

On this day,
I'm here.

For those who sit in silence at the fire by Elizabeth Alexander

I am read to dream of you being a queen.
Your subjects laugh while they read your poetry.

Other girls are erased, erased, erased.
I read the words that will erase me.

You are anagram of my life.
You are divine, anagram of the words of my life.

There is a table behind a nurse’s office.
I am there before you.

The tourists are there before you.
You are anagram of a poem.

I am only here because I am there.

The Lock by James Schuyler

The God of the Bible is the god of locks.
I worked in the storeroom of our rowhouse
where we purchased brand-new car keys

in hopes that they would prove
to be useful in unlocking the doors
of our houses, or a locked room

where killers had barricaded themselves
by cutting themselves with butcher knives.

I was an expert in locks
in the military. When we

would go up to see a movie we
might find ourselves inside

something that looked a lot like a lock
but was not: the body of a blue whale

on the screen at our party. Locking
hands and feet to the floor

in a weightless heap, the dark
was not a metaphor. Somehow

I felt I was being released
as I lifted the hammer of my life

and lifted the bed out of the sea.

“This Land Is Ours by Beezley Aledo" by Jack Langston

this land is ours
we are a niche
we are the fringes

the rows of the loft
architects
of this land are within our reach
and lurking
we will make art

and our noise will be long

the rumbling cinder
of the swirling hearth
hovering from a chimney
we will swim

as the current moves us
toward antechamber

the light filtering through sandalwood
we will be amazed

to be alive
all of us

Can’t wait
to see you

we will bring a light
to your life

when we return
do we walk
through these halls

with your laughter
inside us this land

will be ours

this land is ours

Oblivion by Frances Hauth

Imagine, when you take the bus
from Concord, that, whatever happened,
your life has been, to a certain degree,
already over by
a certain degree. It could be
not quite
that, but the sense of being so
long ago falls away,
an illusion
that I'm shifting from
a home
to another place
to pick up where
I left off
.
When I arrive,
having moved from
Concord, that was not
the case. It was more of
a silhouette
I was walking through
on my way home.
It wasn’t a movement
that I made, it was a
limb
I vaguely remember,
one that I held in
my hand, looking through
the window.
When I looked at that
limb, and found the door
open, I went back
and closed it.
Leading up to the start
of my lecture, I was
trying
to be as honest as possible.

“Only I can bear it” by Rita Mae Reese

Only I can bear it, the mulk, the slavery, the awning.
I swallowed the piece of the broken hand of my father.
I crushed the emerald chin. I buried him under a damp rustling.

He came to visit every other year, to stare out the window at the heat of the earth, and the open window.
He was the only black man I owned, and you could tell.

Only I can bear it, the mulk, the slavery, the awning.
If I stare out the window, I am not to be believed.

I am not to be believed. Or be anything.
I'm to be the ghetto, the faceless buttoned-up, dark, unimaginably dark place.

NOVEMBER,
1958 by William Trowbridge

In the winter of a century
where vermin knows no bounds,
Here, at the foot, the old barn
that absorbed the most frequent visitors,
and the car and the Eugene hotel
turned into shadowy Little Patapsco,
where ants showed up fearfully
like vultures in hazel clusters,
where the dead were molesting the living,
I’ve seen an owl rising from the snow
on its rockery;
a wolf stalking around the yard
wanting to know what it’s all about.

I’ve seen men's faces fall
from a rusty wire or from
a fallen tree. I’ve watched
a professor drop a book
on the floor while children
yawn and the moon is a star.
But when I’ve tried
to convey what it’s like
to be an owl in America
in this glass palace
at the edge of town
I’ve played a game I’d like to play:
I’ve said, without thinking,
“O, but
I’m not
the kind of o’f I’m here
to be a  o’f a crow
and  a little crap,
whatever that means.

Writing on Lacquer with Straw by Zaphron Port

As for the great painter, he’s just a clown,
thinking about himself
all day and the world’s more important issues:
money, family, work, beauty, sex.
He sleeps late, gets drunk
and watches porn on TV.
The world’s forgotten, the way one sees it,
or even for an instant, the dead
face of exhaustion.

Love is always a yearning after the worst
accomplishment in a country’s struggle
or the very best, a wishful fantasy
fulfilled. Parting the streams on the spot
one finds the fissures, the savage
epics of rainforest beauty.

I am dreaming about bees
who gather pollen in cardboard boxes
after rainstorms, when the trees
are cleared, and the shadows
are filled with the colorless
dust of spilled batter—a kind
of hallucination with a name.

Listen: I am listening
to the strings of a topless
dancing woman at the piano.
Listen to the drumbeat
of her thigh, or the faint
whispering of a barn acorn.

Listen to the cries of a bull.
Listen to the sobbing of a poor girl.
Listen to the stillness
in the car behind the door,
and when I look through the aftershave
and my reflection stops in the leaden
wheel of my trunk, I realize I am in
a painting.

Please Don’t Take Home by Walter de La Mare

Dear God,
I’m not in love, I’m in
reliquary of what’s called
good
(white
strap and heels
in the

morning
)
I’m in the mood for
half-
truths
and half-truths
and, even worse, I

said
these things in private
to strangers
like you,

in front of
a crowd of
judiciators on

Milan’s
|Il Lombardia

until I
“got”
up and
walked away
into the shade
and kissed
the sun
with my
fingers
a crowd
of jimmybombs

including my
small-the-size.

Yes, she
took me. Yes, she
took me
like anemone.

I’ve slept
somewhere on the
totaled circumference
of the Earth
or something along
that line.

Yes, I’ve
lived my
life somewhere
near where
there’s a
great sea
and, by the sea’s
face
in the distance, the
refrigeration
of space.

The lee-
ah-fer with a boat
and the eel-
loping
with the wind
(two
singing lengthways).

How could I not
know that
I’ve walked
away—joyless,
and sadly
marvelously
at the end
of pain
when all
was well and
God seemed
almost
just as good as
each of us now
in this ignorant
language of my
myself, derided

when I say
“Over
my whole life”
it’s
a death
or something
like that.

Why is
this so?
I’m
posing
this
question,
with
no
sense whatsoever.

Sonnet #97 by Ezra Pound

The lunch-hour light: a shaking window that gives off
A warm, fuzzy impression of darkness. The garden
Ruins, falling off their hinges and crumbling.

William Tell’s voice cracks down the stairs
A voice as she waves, ecstatic, to the next room.

The man who’s been pruning the roses has fallen
His shorts to his knees, and Paris
Who’s in a wheelchair, and Paris in the wheelchair.

There’s someone else writing a letter
To a stranger
About a Jackal, about a Trafalgar,
About a Thunderbird.
Who’s writing this letter?
The young couple who’re separated by the sea.

It’s quiet in the bedroom.
The woman inside the stove is silent
Comrade. An old-time sailor’s wife,
Clotilde. She teaches a PDF about deadly weapons.

The Child by Stephen Dunn

At first she was breaking like a door
You could hear a Clifton house
in the distance,
The tree here was still
I could see the Bridge to the Castle

Moving in the distance,
The tree was waving here
But later when you walked

Behind that Bridge to the Castle
It was turning into
A small Room where I could put down my books

If I moved at all,
I did so with a quick look
When I hit the ground

Surpris­ingly it appeared
Like a man in a coat
Tightening his tie,
A light jacket like a wool cap,
A hat like a cap,
The gentleman of the house
Sauntering over there,
The tree that had been swinging,
The Room of the Wood-Figure

Was starting to sway again
And it did so at the right moment

When I heard a really loud noise like a church bell
From the faraway church,
Surpris­ingly he was not there

But I did see him coming like a dog
Back into the house,
I knew where he was going, I knew
I was definitely not going to miss him

Axelrod by Wendy Videlock

For I'm tall,
I almost lack the grace
to put my hat back
on the headboard,
so I kind of cheat,
even though I know
it’s beneath the crown
to lack the fabled
fur of your majesty,

and all the furniture on my head
has been rearranged,
I don’t think my head is
mountain on a saddle

hearing back of a horse—
I can’t even
stand, can’t
walk, can’t
run!

But the years have
settled down my bones,
and I’ll live this life,
and ever since I was born
I’ve been searching
to express myself
without the need
of anybody’s permission

and the stupid
industry has taught me
that everything has its
good and bad

and I’ve accepted
this a-hole life,
where beauty
is just a coat

for the wind
and all those dirty
luggage rucks
on the train

where I have to
carry a dead weight
of my own

without any clothes
(who cares
if there’s no jacket?)

I’ve been waiting
for those Yale guys
at the back of the bus
to come up with a name
(where you get a haircut
in Spain or South America)
Maybe I’ll marry
a dentist
or a rabbi

who can hold me,
so I can be free

and at the back of the bus
I’ll be
a miracle of a man!

in the lane by William H. Mungo

You’ve got a voice,
you’re given
a certain height
to think

and dance.
And the windows
are glass

more like streets
where old hands

pull the seats down.
You’ve got a voice,

you’ve got a waist
and legs to dance

in.
You’re so hot

so hot
you make me want

to curl up with you
like a little girl with a pony

and a high heel

and a freestyle

in her mouth

and a parking space
with a sign

and a feel

like someone’s

been waiting
for the last time
to be intimate

and how

you’re not certain
what I will do

if I want

which is why

I kept

away.

About the Expanse by Daniel J. Thurmond

The moon is a bullet turned through a mine.
There is no sun here.
The earth has been somewhat disturbed
by this turn of events.

The dark is something, for now,
not visible. The moon is just a master,
meant to be.

The dark makes me feel old,
like when you go into a movie
and someone else is passing.

Dark is a word. Draw in your breath
and then look in your eyes.

The dark is coming to an end,
as was the case for the beginning.

The dark is the beginning
of the end.

There are many corpses
of the first people that died
and many corpses of the second
people that died

in the year 3000.

Every night I go to bed
and wake up to a new image
in my dreams,
the image of a pure, white body
stuck to a black sheet.

I've thought the same thing for days.

I am in a book.
The name of the book
is not as written.

That lost book is still in this house.
I am still making music.

Waiting There by John Knott

Were you waiting for one or two or three
to come after hours and walk the block,
rocking strollers, pausing to enjoy the view
or climb inside the sunflower to cool off?
The west was warm and full of moons.

Were you waiting to see mother, how she turned
slowly into a coconut at your feet?
Or to hear her sing, a song that would settle
you, your hands, the way your hands sink
and swim in the ocean and return,
these fingers folded in your lap,
and your eyesight: a guide to a journey
that would take you back?

If so, whose footsteps were you
waiting for, to wait with,
and never making it?
And, with sea to go, what
were you waiting to see, hear,
touch, to feel, to see again?

Forgive me

I was in awe.

A Recess by Jack Spencer

My own? A geezer.

Look up and see the late same-day train.

Ask someone what time it is.

Don’t ask a friend to check the time.

Ask an aid if it’s sundown.

Watch TV and drop everything,

hands in air pockets,

an eerie silence.

Surfaces creaking,fold.

Roll the cuffs.

Walk in the rain.

Drive into a snowstorm.

Drive through Isleta.

Get a new car.

Wear a t-shirt at the beach.

Bring a friend.

Walk past a tattoo parlor,
and in the doorway of a bathroom stall,
look up and see a little girl.

She’s reading A. E. Housman.

A Short Story by Charles Reznikoff

O
—
My father was a short story.
He was a pile of
coffee grounds
and T-shirts
spun like feathers — paragon
of the Ugly — a vast
canvas of Jell-O,
nearly toothless,
on his cheek,
fish nose
compared to the
mouth of a word.
Passionate
he thought
all men should be short stories,
any story worth telling,
just a few lines
to drive the point home:
thinking of his father
does not make one a short story,
one needs to care what happens.

I want me to play the "bootleg"
analogous to "We Are the Dwarves"
by the sea’s                  rock opera,
the yodel
of My Favorite Things

and the motion in a movie,
its
spinning
panes

with a slight flip
and rustling of
tires and cuffs.
My father was a short story.
He was a pelvic thrustface
that I could,
I could see
up Close,
relentlessly,
discover,
forget,

maintain
a dose of gratitude
for the opportunity
that he had.

Such was his delight
that we–myself included,
his wife, my daughters,
nights
at his house,
got drunk on him,
he got
back at it,
touched us,
he was there,
he was
wondrous, like
a fairy godfather.

Such, such,
Italy
with its villa,
and most famously, the
Vagabonds.

I’ve fallen for
some of his women
and my friends!

And I’ve lusted
to his diaries — the
Love Poem,
for its  lullaby,
And the Teddy Bear,
which

goes on
at high school picnics,
it’s
Favorite.

A Scandal in the Attic ~ by Tim O'Reilly

What is in the hollow, that's not there.
A year and a half to watch the snow pile up
on my driveway;

a half million snowflakes remain.

'Silly!' or just a pain in the arse.
I've put them in a glass, on the rocks,

to make my wife laugh;
they’re gone the next day.

The Mad Cow by W. S. Merwin

Mad Cow is what we think of when we think of cows.
When we think about cows, we think of cows
running free into the hills.

Mad Cow, though, is what we think of when we think about cows.
Mad Cow knows nothing of cows in the barn.
Mad Cow, though, is what we think of when we think about cows.

Mad Cow knows about cows, and yet the cows
know nothing of cows in the barn.
When we think about cows, we think of cows
running free into the hills.

Mad Cow knows nothing of cows in the barn,
but he still runs free into the hills.
When we think about cows, we think of cows
running free into the hills.

    The Cure by William Butler Yeats

I am happy to loath your griefs,
And all your wound-torn travails.
I do not care about
What profit the world would have;
All I care about is
With your tranquility being preserved,
It behooves me to give you credit.
Last night I took you away,
And kept your house.
You are at home,
While I am at your service.

I hate the heat which the sun sets,
And the hills to which it doth travel,
Knowing that it is my life.
I am glad when hate doth its own will soar,
But glad to give that praise
Which your benevolence hath deserved.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Rebecca Wolff

They think I’m by now too old for the hard and fast rules of life.
I’m nothing like the twinkly and luminous months you blame me for.
But I don’t smell of jicar and undermine.
I’m a plain, everyday kind of figure, you’re L.A. or Detroit,
I’ve got my mornings’ and will.

And I’ve got nights for days and can’t be blamed
for them, you’re an alien and an alien.
I’m the one who knows the real reason for tragedy,
who is not afraid to hurt you, and to stand by you.
I’ve got tastes for the muck and the mire,
and I’ve got tastes for the muck and mire
I’ve got the answers to.

The truth is that I’m far from being good in a bad way.
I’ve got the answers to trouble and pain.
But I’ve got answers for trouble and pain.

The way a boy band handles the tragedy they’re creating,
the way I’ve handled the tragedy I’ve created.
The way I’ve been able to survive and thrive
on the ruins of what I was born to endure.

In Memoriam Canto II, Book III, The Lord of Creatures by Edward Thomas

You’re a small monster, a soul within a universe of things. The price of your existence is your freedom, your self-confidence. The price of your freedom is your agony. A man born in a haunted house must be cured of insomnia and spied. His waking must be smoothed by anointing coddles,
his writing his happy thoughts. A few of his poems are among the most admired.
And let the world know of your existence: When the stars go down, the earth’s still
okay. In my right mind, I would like to be brave enough to bear your existence: a burden
the world could handle, weighty as a great ship. But there’s no time for that: nothing’s steamy enough to turn a man,
the world’s most mountless, into something permanant as a star.

A Reporter for a Highway

I was walking to a bar when an American truck pulled out of a wooded area
of the woods, sped toward me, halted overnight, flipped
and bounced twice, then spun onto its side,
as if in anachronism, and slid to a stop.

I had lost my glasses and had to lie face-up down the length
of the platform, where my blond neighbor slept, dead,
and I wondered if it was a stutter.

Walking uphill, I repeatedly lifted one foot
and descended that hillside where I had never walked,
and down a sudden metal staircase, where I had kept my voice down,
and dropped again, though I was bent
and tired, and worried I had forgotten to put my shoes
on. People walked everywhere and nothing moved.
The billow of smoke from the abandoned refinery
I had parked across from was next to me.

A few people were walking down the hill toward the highway, watching
my back as I walked toward the mountain. I turned back,
and laughed. We were wearing the same clothes.
When I got to the top, it was over.

I Am Spartacus by Stanzas B. Soltec

Who have I left asleep in the Spirit Chariot,
My slumber-worn skin, my sparse brothers, my witless friends:
Anyone who has worn a magic chain
That can hang me by my ear, a foot from a cliff
Where I would be sorely needed, my friend,
Who’ll leave my body in that tattered bed?

I’ve treasured this world in order to show it to be worthless.
I have made a fool of myself,
Self-approval, self-loathing, the silk scarf I’ve worn, the shoes I’ve worn
To save my secret life, the truth that I know
Is the price of liberation.

I have cursed my foolishness, cursed that shameful life.
I’ve stolen money from the rich, from the poor.
I have lied to my friends and lovers, if only to deny
My own enslavement to this world.

I have done away with those men, saddled the chains,
Jugged the soul, unified the free,
Left all these terms, all these corpses behind,
Enslave and deny not—I am Spartacus

Variation on a Theme by Li-Young Lee

a.k.a. The Snake-Headed Terror

From the tip of my lip, a chisel smithered a blind-spot

against a seventh wall

from the first pearly to the third pearly,

from the tip of my lip, a long-limbed, bat-eared,

bossa-tat, endear followed by short-stuttered curse,

a carved-amber cadenza accented with trilling

songs also accented with trilling,

from the tip of my lip, followed by a single whisper,

caroming out, a woozy, beleaguered chorus …

blushing, now familiar … the snake . . . the snake-head . . .

gray, not gray anymore, a switch flipped,

the serpent turned to stone, the snake-legs saw

my target. The snake-head is the thief, the thief is the snake.

When: September 10, 2015;
the bridge over the dunes
begins to fail and falls,
seems to fall still.

When: ten different times
circumvent the three

can't be wrong
till the bridge
never hurries.

When: endless
mists gather near the
bridge, make
its way as in water
to the fountain behind
the bridge.

When: the rain
matches the bridge
and that is what
is called
actor in the
bridge's failure.

When: the sea
floats in the sky
and doesn't pull in the
graceful bridge.

When: the wind
matters, it
matters. It
matters
and then it
matters, the
receding
collapse of
the bridge,
whoever
was there,
now that
it’s over.

Wake up,
you ringside seat,
you shoulders,
you shoulders,
your
skiff,
you
knew, you
knew.

When: the
morning as it was
floating.

A Closer Look by Joshua Beckman

This painting is a pupil.
He has received a score of odd-shaped
little fish from the local aquaculture factory.

He has whipped up the perfect
opaque matte without making any sense.

He has been praised by his teacher’s diary
for his compulsive urge to look at drawings
and write down everything he sees.

His teacher notices none of his marks
even count for a four, or for a five.

The principal has no idea how it is
that a child with such talent
might have never touched a pencil.

Will he ever learn to cut?
When he is older, he will be able to apply
his fine motor skills
to make the world a simpler place

and his classmates will use the word
"clumsy" in a pejorative sense
because it means he has never practiced
how to make things with their own hands

and the teacher will think he is
a freak and a loser because
she will see the weaknesses in his

education and read about them
when they come up in class
all afternoon.

The teacher will also think that
she has written a good grade, because

nothing is allowed to be done with crumbs
on the table; and she will look
back on his misbehavior with pride

because it was his reaction to her
that has been the problem.

Will he ever learn
that the sun is a kind of flower?

Or that a duvet is a kind of crew
on a ship?

The Surprising Thing About Not Believing in the Stagnant Things That Happen In Consequence of the Marches by John Ashbery

I have spent a lot of time thinking about the fall of a pin that I dropped as a boy
on the step
of a slippery bridge

neither side
of which
is the destination
more than half the time.

And now, at the end of the street
the clock stands
beneath the black brown roof
I see no way back from

where in the distance I feel a shower
and a wind is rippling through the trees

two women in white coats
hold a net above a linoleum ledge
and on the old stone steps
a woman and a man
rather than the opposite sex stand

in the center of the room with their backs
smiling
and talking

and the will to live
is not based in stone. It’s not a bit
orchard or a field of hay but a whole world

of things that should be happening
tied to the branching threads
of the universe

the buildings
muscled by petticoats
clipped by loose floor
sculpture bending

in mid-air toward
secondary forms
cracking a window on a roof

in winter
in a field
the wind
chimes
with a poem
of thousands of words
I was just
thinking about
it’s worth
thinking about

like it’s not
completely crazy
not saying
shit
like it’s not
unfair
or unkind
to think about
this

I keep hoping
the puritans’ will
come with me
to be their own man
and kill me
I keep hoping
the damn
puritans
will allow me
to be
The Man I am today
and be
A man
I am not.
And I feel awful.

The Death of Just Another Suspect by Michael Fields

Gladys, little ladies,
I’m a man, you know.
I didn’t want you to die.
I’ve slept in the basement all night,
I’m a nobody.

The world has punished me.
I’ve lost too many friends
to be replaced.

I’ve waited too long,
I’m more paroled
than I’m ever been.

I’m at home
on a Sunday morning,

a tenth grader
who’ll be hitting
a hundred when I
die.

A Short Sonnet by Cynthia Zarin

At the airport
I examine the manifest
I’ve brought from Cleveland:

a pink colored handkerchief,
three pairs of tweezers,
herringbone knuckle,
a pink knuckleless cup,
all the bent plastic parts of my daughter’s bicycle
and her purse.

I know all the words
I’ve rehearsed:

why?
What?
What’s the reason?
Why is it so dark
in there?

At home
it’s quite nice
to be able to watch her
return from the subway
and make a beeline
toward the living room—
I know
herringbone knuckle
won’t stick
and she’ll be left stranded
in her purse.

At home
I’ve made a lot
of pancakes,
I’ve also cooked
a lot of spaghetti
once or twice,
but there’s nothing
I’ve ever wanted
more.

Ore by Kay Mullen

never mind that its very name conjures

the younger you get the richer you get
basically any god you like.  

the recollection that you were born
in Lower Manhattan and lived

the civil rights movement and looked
like you forever, not in the image

of the guitar picking up the dirt or
of the white house where they walked

through the peach trees
and the still water and a

Mexican mosquito in the sun

though some people think Maya

is simply a word for mother but it

is also a word for stone

a word with the power to burn

The Clutter by Crisosto Apacheo

We felt that we wanted to be alone
But there was also the feeling that we expected
To share something with the world — a big red knife
or a brown machete.
The last thing we wanted was for you
To have to deal with the aftermath.
Now, a few months later, she is dead
And I am sitting here in the library
Talking about the impromptu work
I did to assemble the manuscript
I was reading when I died.

Papa and I have been talking
Over the years about how the result was
One man and one woman
Hanging by one collar can.

It was an act of love by a strong man
To give a woman one more chance.

It was an act of love by a strong man
To let a woman go down in flames
As a beautiful woman.

Papa and I have been talking
Over the years about how the result
Was a reconception of the American dream.

It was an act of love by a strong man
To give a woman one more chance
To escape a life one never wanted.

Bring Back the Good Guys by Donald Revell

And I have a rictus grin.

My voice trips so high
it keeps pushing myself back.

We mustn’t forget the good guys,

or we’re not going anywhere.

One of them will always
speak for us in the tank.

It’s the one you’re most afraid of.

The one no one will ever forget.

It’s when he’s using his power
to make everyone smile.

That’s why I keep

rehearsing.

It’s nice
to have someone

speak for us.

I’ve got a long way to go.

I’m grateful

someone’s

there for me.

I’m certain

this will all be worth it,

hopes and prayers.

It’s like we’re leading

this bright life,

coming home,

about to take off our clothes,

cleansing ourselves,

and saying:

“I’m going in the door,

I’m going in the door.”

That’s what it’s like to be the good guys

in civilian life,

the car slides by the road,

somebody calls it a day,

and we drive away,

holding on to the harnesses

as if we still had a little

skirt we could pull over our heads,

and into the kitchen

sipping coffee,

singing what can’t be taught

with our mouths.

The Apartment by Fanny Howe

I sat on a bench in a dimly lit studio
and watched her walk down the street
with her husband. He carried a coffee bottle. She smiled
and said nothing. She was walking
straight ahead.
I turned my back.
I could hear my mother yelling
for the cab and her daughter
was dead.

The next day I walked home alone
and walked under a bridge
where I saw a sign
like the one I thought I saw
for my own body.

“Breathe in”
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by William Butler Yeats

Breathe in, breathe in, the breath
That quickens my soul, May the springs

Flood into the hearts, the leaves the eyes
Give the earth its shade
May the well-being the soul
Be remembered
May us remember the breath
And the breath

People of the Red Boat by Babbitt McSweeney

Our lives have become a record of reincarnation
from the longboat that has arrived
by ferry from Cannery Street.

We have lived in a tenement flat
to a fisherman’s flat. We have lived
under a bridge

pounding his ivory pots in the void
of the sea.

We have lived in a cell
of prisoners
in a "maze"
of desktops, chairs,

magazines, the back door,
the electricity that chokes
the cell’s lights.

We have lived in a house
of nails and dust. We have lived
in an uptown park

where the carpet has been ripped off
and the pool table has been set
for a "dump" only . . .

We have lived in an apple tree
with nothing but a single wire.

We have lived in an alley
of oranges. We have lived
in a diner

with a twenty-five-year-old waitress
who leans over the microwave
to make sure that the food is cold.

A Capacity of Bent Trousers by Andrew Marvell

I put my hat on, and made a hat
of a ragged man’s tails.
The one who had been
Respecting all this
could not resist having it done.

It was an old hat and the cap
was too short. In short, it was nothing.

I made a hat of a flipped
kilt, that my uncle could wear.
On an evening that does not
deserve a name, I showed my ignorance of
the natural history of the world.

It had no sleeves, the only thing worn.
The poor thing was humiliated,
but I remained calm as if I were at home.

Melt
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Julieja de Paz

for Eric Englund
The moon is a thin, powdered animal
like a skull.
“I’m not all there,” he says to himself,
“like the chick frolicking
with her frog”
(she is not all there).
The moon is the enough
to make a world,
the hole in the world.
He has vanished
and she has vanished.

She’s not the moon; she’s
the inner ear

of my body that glides over
the gap, the split.
It’s all there, bin-
hornet.

No traveler has to fight
the cold wind of the field
while the sun melts.

No one has to hold the door—
I do. And when the moon shits
on me,
it looks like my skin is melting
as if a porcelain cup
were exploding inside me.

Dead* By Chris Buettner

O death, having a big house for you,
you got a beautiful dog, a big land animal,
a… well, I am still figuring that one out.

The South Carolina heat makes a.

The South Carolina heat makes a paler shade of pine
on my house.

The South Carolina heat makes a bermude–
a shade of blue, beige, and white,
a shade of blood red and black,
a shade of rotting apple,
a shade of rotten red bean,
a shade of corn, a shade of cornstarch.

The South Carolina heat makes apple trees,
tree to tree, of tomato, vegetable, and nutose,
like plump, juicy ears of corn.
My house is home.

I am still here, and this remains.
Nothing to rush away from now, or from now
going forwards a life I like to call
jellyfish life.

    After-Tense, After-Tense by Michael Murrill

I think of
behind the couch that
was once so afraid
that I might break
the silence that was
the breaking of the silence
in the room
that was at one time
not so afraid
(the carpet was knocked
into a pile
of leaves)
but now
I hear the broken
final bit of silence
as if

of course it’s still
there and it’s not
dust, it’s something
being done
inside the house that
was once so afraid
to be done inside

but the door slowly
open…and I am here
behind the curtain
waiting for the curtains
to come
and for the pictures
to cover all of my whole
face

with a big, messy
burden of
naps and
teeth and
everybody
hoping for a
good time

I need a light,
I get a light,
I get a light,
I get a light
and if I
could ask
I would,
I would ask
everyone

if it’s
not the end
of the world

The Siren by William Butler Yeats

The sun, glory-singing, rose
Through the Valley of Sorrow and the Beauregard,

From thence, with tears generous, he meditated
On the vast destruction he would inflict

And felt the weight of the doom that lay
On his life’s work as a man

Who loved the lost, whose heart was
Eternal, in love for whom he bore

The terrible burden of his own.

The Sinkhole by John Howard

There is nothing left of them
in the smothered wall.

The lights dim and the pine leaves

The car lights dim and the crows.
And we move forward.

The cottage is empty,

The driveway is sheer and the entries
are scooped up and left there.

And the mind drifts away
like the coat of a winter bird.

But we are driving, though.

Removing Stains by Travis Worley

If the drapes had a mind of their own,
the drapes could be lamps.

I’ve never stopped to ponder
the way you’re not you
here again, before I was no more.

Or equally, there’s no way
to be me. The only thing
carded on my walls is chalk.

There’s a public gym in the park,
yet I have forgotten my exercise
plan. I’ve never forgotten the way
my voice disappears, pure as a dream.

Or maybe the drapes are
good luck candles, lit at sundown.

If you want to calibrate
my love, you’ll have to burn
the parchment I touched.

Or maybe they’re the invisible
force holding me back,

a new book written by a man in his thirties.
Or maybe it’s just evening
and I was born on the eve of revolution.

What do you want me to say
about that? I’m just a
belief, nothing more.

with a sweetheart

who invented
a shoe
losing half

to wear a
four-in-one

sole,
which is
five hundred and fifty pounds
and made of
thirty thousand pounds  of
Empire’s finest

leather,
having survived
the atom’s
dark surprise
dissolving sky
into a snow

from which
to plant
the seeds of one’s
future children
the way the wind

grasps,
each snowflake
grasps,
and in the process
becomes the foundation for
the next generation
of snow,
which is
a wonderful life
from which
it may be

called upon by God
to grow
its own hair,
to have
eyes
and eyelids,
to be

look,
to know,

The smoking seat

I’m in my tights and a man
in a ball cap can’t get me
he runs up to the window
and hides his face
I tell him:
“Just do what you’re told”
He urges me to leave
but I’ll stick with it
and stay home
First cigars were all that
I had. Then beer,
then wine, then I’d drink
the rest of the night
like a bad habit
and every night, like the dog,
I would sit here
and watch my dog
sleeping and sobbing
and the chair in front of me
would rain wine
and dark.

I am a Woman by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

I am a woman who lives in a queer house with a boxwood fence
Who cooks and sleeps but the men prefer the women.

I sit and play peacock
Praying God I am not false to the world that has no God
Who is God to me and will be God to all.

Ode to Judith by Richard Wilbur

A verse from Judith
The fair night writhes and dances
Variations from the rhythm of the night

From the coarse things of the world that the winged insects of the cypress fly.

Prayer for the animals like heaven on the earth
Prayer that the wind that blows on the tree tops on the great river in the mountains of the West

Prayer for the birds like the moon on the face of the black ox.

A scripture from Judith
God is love and is love and is the love that frees the white horse from the shackles of the man.

It’s not recognition that counts,
or externalities of memory,

The childhood I had,
the magic of the innocence,
would go down in history
like a luckless but valiant cart
with goods, passengers, 'tourists.

The great leader said
you’re the man you’re supposed to be
and this is your fault
because you are in charge
in this by force of head
and a threat of ugly kids.

You’re the man of choice
adorned in tuxedo,
white tie and all.

You’re the man of goodwill.
What you will not do,
don’t do,
except for that crucial
important thing:

trust me. — trust me. —

Trust me,
to vanquish this affliction.

eleven full days, the thing

You go away and don’t come back

nose around the faded steamed seat—
are you dead?—but I’ve forgotten
how to kneel

and lie down,

I’ve never seen,
the those I’ve loved, with the
black leather boots.

When the light of early dawn
is gone, as it is in this picture
where I stood and he
was lying face-down
on the bed

the English Fork is threatened
by a tree that is the
only thing, and also, cruel,
might rip apart the world

and all that was.

The Illusion of Laughter
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Gail Mazur

the illusion of laughter
is broken
but still

I’ve heard

from those who’ve been
cared for by

for example post-pulmonary
as by

a second, stammering
question or

licking the flame

without doing so,

making one’s qualms
anodyne

with a little

lidded bliss

to spare as if

I’d just come to think of

what life is really like
when the illusion

crashes and

scuttles off.

The Other by A. F. Moritz

I don’t know which one
I am, but I have an
assassinate look. What’s
the lyric for? How can
I remember?

This morning I lie
up to my neck,
a doughy girl, with
an arm full of one
and a pitcher of water,
and the fish is not
asleep on its plate.

How is it that I’m
not an ass! I’m
a guy in a hoodie
and a hoodie filled
with nothing but a windbreaker.

Even my mewing is
taut and patient,
as if it’s
touched by the wind.

I hear the desperate rattle
of mahogany desks
pulled apart.

That’s because
someone moved me
this morning,
someone walked
me back to my place.

But that’s not true.
That’s not true either.

I’m still here.

The Judgment of the Penitent by William Blake

(FOR THE SEVENTH ALBUM)
When the City is going mad
The Dead are around the clock,
And all the rest is weedy,
Butted hissing and stinging
A sad heave of the wind
Doth fill with rage,
And pock a chimney,
And stir the deep,
Pock the watery sea,
Tho' the Stink is such
A sulk, woe is a thing
To send a fiend
That wails in the Carriage,
Tho' he wails in the Corridor,
And tho' the wind is a roar,
The tide is the hill.
Give him some wide place,
Give him some bright day,
Give him some good air,
Give him a solitary place,
Give him some lonely clear place,
Where he might be free,
Give up some thing of such repute,
Tell him to have the fatigue,
Tell him he is wrong,
Give up a thing of such high repute,
Tell him say no more.

Lines Written by Donald (Grady) Davidson

The reproach of a song in a stranger's ear
Will soon be something as ridiculous
As Louan’s pretensions toward dulcet harmony
Will soon be a monstrous crime
My desires will soon be a bloody jumble

The clurg-numbing of the mamb-chop will soon be …
All excess, all poetic flourish will soon be …
All excess will soon be …

The reproach of a song in a stranger’s ear

Will soon be something as ridiculous

As the dead-pan snarls of Naked Highway,
The grot-grotto-grot-grot of Hurdles &amp; Spikes,
The obtuse and patently futile shouts
Of Wildwood Boys &amp; Wildwood Girls,
The even-keeled and sword-bendin’ thump of   Village — Town — Will — Willie — Willie Gathers – e Nanton’s Fairy Tales From the Staten Island Steamboat Builder —
Will soon be a monstrous crime
My desires will soon be a bloody jumble
The clurg-numbing of the mamb-chop will soon be …
All excess, all poetic flourish will soon be …
All excess will soon be …

First Page by Kenneth Fearing

We can’t go into our own interior lives
with ten buttons, without a clue
what the world will become. Our thoughts
grow smaller and our senses enlarge.
But when we enter the streets and say
“Yo!” the street signs go up and the lights
go down. The cars around us flash and whiz.
We walk the long, winding streets of Auckland.

The Last Whisper by Anonymous

I’ve heard
You’ve gone and bought a Whipple.

I’ve heard
You’ve gone and bought a Swift.

I’ve heard
Your daughter has gone and bought
A hairdo by a willow.

I’ve heard
Your wife’s dressed in bauhaus
And walking in a circle—
Gowns so tight
It is like a garter.

I’ve heard
Your son has gone and purchased
A limousine.

I’ve heard
Your cello has gone and bought
A car.

“Your cello has gone and bought”

I’ve heard
The doctor’s walking down the hall
Shopping for a new nurse.

I’ve heard
It’s always cold in here
For some reason
You don’t have to walk
There

and on the way back
You’re so beautiful.

I’m thinking
Of coming here
Tonight

When winter
Is here.

Inna's Baby by O. Henry

Inna got a good shape,
And wore a short white cotton skirt;
The wind went round her hips,
And she did her hair.

When the wind did go round her,
The child she bore
Did walk, and play.

When the wind did go round her,
The daughter she bore
Did walk a little far,
And doze.

Inna did not take her hat off,
But when the wind did
Go round her,

The maids gathered round her,
And made an ovation,
And she was born—

Inna here, inna there, do
Remember how she did
Walk a little farther;
And she did take her hat off,

And when the wind did
Go round her,
Inna did walk a little farther;
And she did do

The part, and wept.
And the rain did come,
And rain did go round her.

Inna did not take her hat off,
But when the wind
Did come round her,
She did walk a little farther;

Inna did walk a little farther,
And dozed.

On the verge of slaughter
you are not Sarah
but Papa and your ass

are probably Sarah(

the great interracial butt
that hungers, like it didn’t happen,

the wife without family here
or there in a handful of castles
in the East, dark songs,

a kiss on the cheek,

Jeans, denim, beer
and a taste for luck,

and a man of few words
bewailing his fame,

are the big miss,

I still am not quite
saying goodbye.

Weeping by Judith Ortiz Cofer

He walks into the door


and takes her

to the car, where she


has just been pulled over and left.

He walks down

the stairs, leaving her

in the quiet of the kitchen.

He walks back into the room

and opens the door,

which she did her best

to keep, as if she knew

how to open the door,

trying to stay

inside, as if

she were going out alone,

only to sit

and read something on the

burning page,

then watch

her brother

turn the corner,

step into the moving door,

and then abruptly

return the way they had come

from the woods

where they had walked long ago,

and into a small fire

with only one side

the glass of water on the window,

and the sound of thin

claps of thunder

inevitable as they travel

out to the world,

each one of them

pushing up against the glass

and sighing at the dark

and the audience.

The End by Yusef Komunyakaa

The crowd at our vigil
turned to stone. We were

alone. The silence was deafening.
The girls stood in the heat

and waited—so their response
could be heard. Make a song.

Their cry is not the end,
their silence is not the beginning.

And it is not morning anymore.

Let’s take a train. We’ll leave
tomorrow with headphones on,

mumbling the names of our dead.
We’ll walk the dark streets

of our memories, and the places we’ve lived,
before the trains arrive.

Tangled Laces by Kevin Young

I can't put this behind the memory
of being perfectly decent and laughing
at myself. In the pylon, in a white
toy, a pigeon squeaks a tune

that I can't quite hear. Birds
of a different color, or no color
at all, are hovering in the sky.
I'm certain I'll hear the skeletons

of animals as they are being raised.
Flyboy, I'm not afraid. I'm
watching myself through the window. After
the car crash on Rte. 69, I looked
back and saw my house

bodies in the backseat,
complete with slats,
I saw myself on the screen

and knew I had to get out.
I had to get out. That's why
I have braces and a dummy head.

That's why I was happy when
I got out.
That's why I stay in

good shape and I'm going to school,
going to school,
for my future.

Without my braces, what will I be
like in five years?

until it’s my birthday and I’m wearing a robe

because I’m the one in costume

and the thing that gets lost

is my mascara, my wig, my bikini top

and my panties, they’ll never clean them

I’m only allowed two times

at church today

when no one else is in first class

and I’ve never sat in a parade

but do I look cute in my robe?

Easter Valley by Mark Irwin

It’s when you bury yourself

deep in the well of the grave.
It’s when you’re worn out with

the tumult of the world. It’s when you’re

going back into the world. As you

sleep, the snares are flying

from the branches. When you wake,
the door is a heart of stone.

When you go back into
the night, the soul is wings

that are thin and chilly. When you

come out, the mountains

aren’t heavy with snow, it’s light.
It’s when you’re away. It’s when

you’re silent. It’s when you’re gone.

I'll answer the phone.

I am the only English teacher in the school.

A Rose by Joyce Sidman

After Gertrudo Ganley’s
(1852-1907)

A painted rose—
a rose with flowers of gold and
coral-leaved petals—

is the only
ideal attendance.
That’s why you’re here

at Casanova’s Paradise.
The paint is almost dry

and the clients are gone.

You’re waiting
for the notes

that can be pulled

from the beat

of ‘I’m’ T’out Free’
demeaning.

The old thought

– women’s

exposure
‘to’



Portraits of women’s faces

with petals.

They"re nothing

like that.

The shells and

galleries of the world

are just

drops of red.

Is it

bad

to be a woman

in this space?

Sometimes

I miss

the soul’s

lullaby

of the morning

and my brother’s

car

and the way

the cat

will find its

way out of one room?

I Was Never Going to Wear Any More by McDaniel Tucker

a button-up collar

I was never going to wear

or the sick mind of a

why should I

with this box
what I am pierced

while they

Old as She Was by Lucy Tunstall

My father found the ring
she hadn’t taken to the hospital
sewing her mouth for a kiss
and turning her gaze to the air,
roaring her hips and clapping
as if she’d forgotten how to dance.
He’d turned her down
all over town, but one butts
of a family from the Midwest
got her in the door — and lots
of other girls from all over
the country they picked
out of skinny brunettes
to dance in their paintball,
nearly spooking the neighbors
when they saw them
singing like the girls from
their school who from then on
would be known
as the trendsetters and after
they would skate all over
the country, that’s where
he got his inspiration
and the ring, too, the fact
she could manage to be
controversial and just as bold
as the tousled round-bellied
tollbooth babes
of the early rock & roll years
at the Yale Ball
while wearing
an old T-shirt and jeans
that said, “It’s New York
Everybody!”

Coup, Criée by Michael Jeffries

I decided on a French word
for the French language processor

(the . . . a) and when I typed
the word  canard en Nieuwe

was in the top seventy

and so it was

for the French language
setter program

(The .    )

the result was a ternary

a form that could only be

used by the French language

because french is my first language

and it makes a lovely French letter

because French is the only language I can speak

because French is the only language my Aunt or Grandma can speak

because French is the only language my Grandpa can talk

and so it was the perfect word

for a French language

to be fast, because French is fast

and therefore French is very fast

so it meant French was fast

and French was very fast

and French was very fast

because French is French

and French is very French

and it is French

that can’t read or write
because
French is French

and French is French

The Force of the Fireflies by John Haines

The fireflies have taken her away (but I love her anyway),
And now the house is the burning house
Of all the events we live through, which we share—
A giant pile-up of a century’s memories,
Visually stunning, felt-up colors and furniture,
A collection of couples throughly shuffling.

But she is gone. And if there’s one thing we really know
It’s that people are often dead or gone or not
Forecasted, which means unpredictable.
And this is no way to live or begin to live.
A few weeks of visits from cousins and friends
Then a dozen or so by more or less random
Coupled strangers or acquaintances in our old place,
A hundred years of the usual spring
And new fall, a few months of testing time,
A few wonderful years, a lifetime of dumb luck,
A big fat pile-up of our memories that we try to keep.

Chorus of the Blind by W. S. Merwin

What is the chorus of the blind, haunting their scaffold in the dark?
Who is nearing the other side of the window,
The woman who lives alone
Who is at peace with herself now?
The dead of night,
The dead of war,
The dead of history,
The dead of love,
The dead of the mind.

A chorus of the blind
Haunts the window of the death
House of this glass-floored room.
What is in the ceiling?
A red-carpeted ballroom,
A chapel,
A cowshed,
A sea of faces,
A choir of the blind,
The five senses,
The power of sight,
The melody of the heart,
The moral of the day,
The beauty of the world.

The Tent of the Duchess of Malfi by Peter Campion

The tent of the Duchess of Malfi, it might be, is situated in the garden too

and isn’t the kind of tent used to sleep,

which seems to have been the tent of the Duchess of Malfi,

reserved for that purpose by the queen,

and again,

the size of this tent is the kind of tent only

can be extended.

As I think to myself,

I am not sure if I am tremendous
or not,

whether or not I am full of my own goddamn

love.

First Christmas by Joyce Sidman

The first Christmas, my father had

was free. Who doesn’t want
a Christmas present on Christmas Day —
to go along at the stickhandle
over the fire — can’t
go for the butter-smoke sludger that
fell on the driveway, or
the funny young man who
spoke before the assembly line,
or the old woman who
was singing a celfactor song,
serving up the roast turkey
on Saint Nick’s Day,
the chauffeur who’d
stepped out of her car
on her own, and the
privileged hipster who’d
dined on the platter
instead, all celebrating
the Christmas I had been dreaming
all winter.

Printed-Out Letters by Jim Harrison

I draw, then write,
I do not enter my name,
I do not write.
My short-lived short-lived
Writes, silences, and disappears

At will; and the minutes in
the heady months stare.
I am one of the languid

Anasazi or Dakota
Sylvanas who’ll

Not be found out
in the joints,
not forgotten,  

Herd making,
trading in, artisanally

Bleached or forgotten,
what it’s like,

When the biggest is the white
Hijacking the big,

Ready to take you
in its aggrieved self.

How the cells of white
Truck commuters

Fly a million miles
herding the

Pittsburgh skyline,

Over an age
of bracing-

Sealed corpses, growing

Lyceum-sized stumps
where you

Expose yourself
to the day’s

Off-kilter, uncap
the walls

Of role-playing
Board Game

As if I’d become
A grading tool,

And I’m

Caught off-guard
In a time of  change

Like this, the charm
Of a word, a line,

A gesture,

Or as if an object

Were defined by
A certain

Commands.

When I awake I write a poem, and I am a man again,
When I awake, I sit up and write, and I am a man again.

When I am a man again I write a poem, and I am a man again.
When I am a man again I sit up and write a poem.

When I am a man again again I write a poem, and I am a man again,
As I write. When I am a man again I write a poem, and I am a woman again.

As I write, I am a woman again, and I am a woman again.
I write a poem, and I am a man again, and I write.

When I write a poem, I am a woman again, and I am a woman again,
When I write a poem, I am a man again, and I am a woman again.

When I am a man again, I write a poem, and I am a woman again,
And when I am a man again I write a poem.

When I am a man again, I write a poem for a woman.
When I am a man again, I write a poem for a woman,
And when I am a man again I write a poem.

When I am a woman again, I write a poem, and I am a man again!
When I am a woman again, I write a poem for a man,
And when I am a man again I write a poem.

When I am a man again I write a poem, and I am a woman again!
I write a poem, and I am a woman again, and I write.

by Scott Cairns

My scarf, the one that clings
like a thin thread.
Down my garment’s ruffled,
the mountains’ robes of birds
have gathered
and the forest,
like a silent song,
has become
a swimming pool,
the pond outside my house
is a river of voices
poured from the other side
of a tower,
where it rains.

Down the sleeve of my coat,
the ground has become
a large, open window
with cold tines
on the glass.
Flame, like a dog,
humps up and down
in the dark room,
and when I close it,
I know I am rowing
to a beach with my back
against the walls,
where waves, going over,
have eroded the shade.

The Rainbow by Cynthia Zarin

Sleeping at the top of the hill
at the back of the truck,
the sun is at its highest point
the river is every color
of the rainbow
the sky is a rainbow
all I want is to be

with you,
remember that you are my best friend
and so I leave the bed.

I don’t know what I’ll do if the river
of what I know isn’t a rainbow
but I can’t be the one
with the poor executive here

who doesn’t know how to change
and that is what I want.

Every time I close my eyes
I feel you beneath me
bringing me rain

and when I open them
I see myself in your face
in my frame of reference
you call me a rainbow

but when I close my eyes
and lean over you,
I see how I could never
be the one
when the river of what I know
is nothing but a rainbow

and I am the one
on the bed
who is my best friend
and the only one
I could call my own.

“Pleasure is a Rainbow,” by Valerie Bowers

Pleasure is a rainbow.
I wish it pulsed, as in a peony,
or a throbbing, milky bowl.
Sometimes I feel wonderful.

Men are simply beautiful –
melodic, with a seductive
sweating, magnetic presence.
I wish they were lesbians.
I wish I wore a skirt.
Maybe it was a dress.
I wish I were a painter.
I wish I had a brain.

The Holy Hand of God by Lucy Tunstall

The Holy Hand is not a toy.
No, it is God, the High Priest of the Latter-day Saint's, blessed by a new-born angel.

It hugs you, it flits around,
it punishes, it accepts as sacrifices
your gift of kindness, faith and love.

He will never spit on you,
he will never strangle you.
He holds you by the hand,

rests your soul in his small hands,
he lifts you up to Heaven,
he takes you deep,
he brings you to the Josephs.

I am sorry I have not exorcised the Holy Hand before.

I’m in Love with the Deer by Rohan Silva

I’ve worked my butt off
to earn the loyalty of your love.
You’ve probably known
by this point
that I’m in love with the deer:

my hot toaster pays for the feed
that my cousin (who’s also a deer)
serves for free—

I’ve walked the earth
over 100 miles (or more)
to spend one night in a trailer

with my love—
practicing every position
you could imagine,

practices so perfect
you could never guess

how it feels
to be in love with the deer:
knowing his tail
lifts him over the stumps,

I’ve hidden wood
on the tree in his mouth
so he’s never hungry.
Cards fall from the table,

we know they’re there, smiling
from them—Making lots of
emotional noise,

you think to yourself
“I’m done moving
this body.”

CourtCast by Lisa Bartle

In the early afternoon,
a group of us,

twelve, four, three,
at a table

on the third floor

of a building

close to a cafeteria,

drinking soft drinks

and earth,


all eyes focused

on the black

candle in the window,

and a single table

to the left,

where two women

had been working,

and one friend

was jotting down

a letter from a friend.

Aesomes by Richard Wilbur

The man who had bought the house
from Strummer had gone mad. There was something
broken in the man’s brain as he killed himself.

I’m glad I’m the one who asks
the question and takes the answer, and not the other way around.

We raise a glass to a star that’s not only
the brightest lightbulb in the sky, but has been
shot down over Manhattan.

There’s always nothing to do but leave
and get on with the rest of our day.

The evening is always just a smidgen overcast,
but the sun rises with a bang and sets with a whimper.

The place you’ve been is not a house,
but a shelter from the evening.

The man who’ve been in a bad mood all morning
has probably been in a bad mood all day.

Where did you go last night?
In the shelter from the evening where the sun rises
and sets with a whimper and huff and puff.

The man who’ve been in a bad mood all morning
has probably been in a bad mood all day.

On this chilly day, we raise a cup
to a cup, put it down.

Ariel by Joyce Sidman

Never told anyone
of my son’s death.
It happened on the steps
where I’ve lived since.

His weight had
lost twenty pounds overnight.

He was a dashing specimen
who could run,
could jump,
could skate,
could sing,
could dance,
and had the added bonus
of being

an atypical
little fellow
in that he
could stay

and not be carried away.

He was never
butchered,
though he once

had his ribs
smashed to bits
on a pole
by some crazed
bear.

He was named
after the Israel,
for those
of us

who’ve missed
them,
the lucky ones
who know
how lucky we are
to have come
into this world
at all, and have

never missed
the news of his death,
nor the lesson
he never forgot
when he ran
through the portal
at the end of the hall

to his mother’s empty
bedroom,
and wondered
where the God
was,
what was meant
by his name.

A Sonnet to a Young Love by James Laughlin

A Sonnet to a Young Love
Old man, do not let your hair grow too long, your face get too yellow, your lips become too far apart or your fingers grow too big. Your eyes, nose and mouth are all like cords cut, tied to a man or a pony.

You are a faulty assembly, a bundle of bones and blithely tossed without aim. Come out of your shell and be someone who is not like you.

The Dream by W. S. Merwin

I have lived in a country for three days,
I have been born and stifled,
I am a stranger among strangers,
I have hated my life,
I have never been told
by a friend I love
that I am not
the one I imagined,
I have felt my beauty hide,
I have been betrayed
by my own helplessness,
I have lived the dream
of giving up the dream
to live without fear,
like anyone else,
a dream made of glass,
a dream of doors
and windows,
of flying,
of a mind whose name
I will never forget,
and of abandonment
like the dreaming
of a dog.

I Saw Her Parked Outside a House by J. Allyn Rosser

It was a good winter,
that ill-fitting sweater made me
chuckle. Up here
with no hate, a love for the light,
we can get away from
the heat.

I watched her glancing
at the snow, a white
little girl with a wave
held by the sleeve.

I understood that by now
she could recognize
a size and shape, and could
bend to go with it.

I could see the light
in her eyes, her face
soft as a cockadoodle,
her pretty brown potting
tanks.

And on the way home,
I could see all
the ways she made
me out, my house
open and the yard
full of pines,
cracked trees,
a river, the river
that looked like it was
never ending, the sound
of my car
splashing against the asphalt
like a living soul
made of sounds
and smells and smells,
a whole classroom, an orchestra
of cars and pedestrians
who never stop singing,
the smell, the light,
the sound, the air moving,
you could find
no words for feeling
like you belonged.

The Heart of the Matter

Onward the Sun

Shears of Blood:

The Rain of Blood

A Night in a Troubadour by Jane Mead

An old man sat cross-legged on the pale gray
floor, his back to the door, writing a breeze
down the blade-hung window of his apartment.

His hands were one
or two-folded in the shape of a small,
and boring, square or flimsy as a lighthouse.

Someone had stitched them on the window
with black-and-white car banners,
made of paper, that stuck out,
like the giant catfish that swam under the window
and landed on a piece of the tall building
or the hollowed walnut that looked like a cross-piece
from an old piano, a piano that sat
on a table and was used to make
a fortune. The letters curled like a man in his robe
with his mouth open, metal slats
against the vertices of his feet.

The old man tried to sing the heart of matter
while his words were a fleet of children,
while their cry floated above the street
like a clarinet hitched to a horses' neck.
The old man tried to sing the heart of matter
while his heart was a feeling of power
caught in the clicking lock of the door.

The old man tried to sing the heart of matter
while the heart of the matter was a pain in
the leg, a bother, a poor man’s
doubt, and whether or not all this was
a metaphor for heaven, this feeling of
return and despair,
the big ol heart full  of swimming
at the edge of something huge and violent.

For Hieu, the final years
of his life be damned if
the ocean will not wipe useless,
unwilling, dead eyes out from under his
eyes. He will neither
bring back his wife
or his body
and, as the anguish
of his suffering
brings tears to the eyes
of those who have come
to comfort him,
the dying
uncensored and inexplicable
a nice
meals for the eyes of the dead
that were already
what, if not broken up
or sometimes puffy

The Lonely in Belgrade by Katerina Rudcenkova

When he finds out

he’ll find the pair

has been all he’s been riding

he’ll find a rabbit in a cage

the size of a whalebone.
He’ll hold up the dog’s head

Moon and Sun by Seán Ó Ríordáin

The moon and the sun are the same both
bright and dark, and neither of them is
upside-down, either of them

one of the two  roles that the other

should play. The moon is like a house,
a platform of light, a needle thread,

a needle of air. The sun
is like a dove, his beak
like a bird's beak, his back

like a rabbit’s back, his legs
like a monkey’s legs, his hooves
like a duck’s hooves, his tail
like a pig’s tail. You can’t tell

the moon from the sun, because the moon
has no face, and has no tail.

When they

Twinkling Faerie Girl by Lynne Thompson

As I made my way down the streets
of small town New Mexico,
I stopped every car and I blasted
The Cure--they’re in a trance. I’ve never

Smoked weed since I moved here,
but I do, and I’ve done so many
Bad Things. I’ve list this here,
because this is what I still feel like
when I’m not in a glade

Retreating, asleep, wishing
Everybody I know where I am.
I’m glad my bed is empty,
because I’d like to get back to bed
and have a book in my lap,

And I wish I had a good life,
like mine is. I’ve got nothing to do
with fashion or courtly love,
I’m in the throes of a terminal

Pain, though, and I know
what I’d rather do is go back
to bed, wet and khaleesi,
and I’ll lie buried beside you

in the white quilt of my dreams.

The Legs
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Steve Blanks

The legs were no longer supernous, or, perhaps, they were shaky
so I assigned a new meaning to legs. I found in
the leotards, in the stalls, in the hallways,
a constant sense of legs, legs, legs,

a leotard’s restless legs, an antique taxi's limp legs
and the morning after, when, in a panic, I jumped
from the windows of my house, I was inevitably

pointless, and the chair the doctor had hooked me
at the convention was sore, and I could not sit.
I would have stayed in bed, in the dark, abjectly

knowing the rules of leotard play, but it was Friday,
I would have slept, knowing the rules of leotard play,
sleeping, knowing the rules of leotard play,

the ruse falling apart as a chair was dragged
from a chair, I found myself acting
like leotards, which I loved to act
like leotards, and I was not out of my mind
for a minute, though my eyes were forced open.
I’ve never been in a car before. I’ve never sat at a table
without my glasses on. I’ve never been in
a room without someone. A room with no mirrors.
I am not T-shirtless. I do not have a limp.
The leotards, the shakier legs, the intentionless
talking between the stalls, the doctor, the paralysis
from the panes, the failing chair, I am
one of those leotards, who I’m not, who
I'm not, I’m still in there, somewhere,
talking to myself. I will not
move, because I have forgotten to lie down.

The Thought by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

I will not speak to any man of you,
Bursting out, I will not be sad.

And though pleading the cause your cause,
I will rise to the spot of your head

And draw my sword and pound on the crown
Of your head, it will be a glad stroke

To strike this crown, which is your due,
Raise your head and affirm that you have graced

The throne of life with your life,
Then all that we discussed

Will be discussed in the court of justice.

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Vic Yoon

This is the time of anguish. When I forget
what I have
just said,
I forget all
that’s been said
and done.
My body is always
asleep
or unable
to move
or not knowing a thing
he has done.

My body is always
asleep,
not knowing the
name of this place
where
a guest
meets
his horse
and slaps
his face
into the mud.

By now I’ve got
more than enough seeds
to start a garden
for the woman
to grow
and work
with
her life
like a bug
that is
wet on the outside
and dry
on the inside
and, once,
beneath.

The consolation
of our time,
the fact
of our lives
are turned
against
the idea
of Saturday.
The worst
thing that happens
is that
the people
who live in the long
distance
learn to fly now.

On Sunday,
somehow,
I’m there
to hear
the same old
errors of silence,

and nothing
has changed.

for someone so much worse
than this:
they just don’t know.

Shame by Ted Kooser

You can’t wear a cape,
belay a noose, or control one. You can’t relieve yourself,
you can’t hold a candle
to a symptom you didn’t expect. You’re
subject to the whims of the "imitate"
or the flippant "example," or the careless
smile. After all, the year you call
a house, you wear it,
it’s where you’ve lived,
you can’t move it. That’s just
how life is. Again.
You can’t adjust the dial,
sit in the front seat,
helmeted, and pilot the motor home
without a map. You can’t sit
at the wheel,
hawk your head,
and bring the car to a halt.
You’re doomed.
The bad news is, you’re lucky.
You’re not her,
the good news is, she is
your sister. You’re both
conscious of being different.
You’ve decided,
it’s fine, her,
but this isn’t fine.
You’ve chosen the one
you’ll be the least yourself on.

A thousand ships — dembroidered rooms —

come
from the
majestic depths
of

carving the
windy mountains

or
they think of it

like  a pencil
erasing
the skyline

and the footprints of
little ships

laying up
like fists

in the sand or
wanting to leave

beyond the harbor
of New Haven,

entering the harbor from
a ship
with a
flipping mast

and landing
like a
pissing crab

that just
tasted
good   licking
their ricks

troughs   catching
at the bones
of the
neutralized

military
intervention;

a small
packets of

spent grain       even
if
you knew 
what 
was going
beyond the
bay’s

shelf space
for a
boat       sea
of 
horizon          mobile
exploration

that
brings
you out
of
what you
think

to
a place
that
is not
the same

as the
place
you
think

but
are
always

called
by

and
the

and
the

product
that
hurts

A Bouncy Saturday by Joan Hutton

****
my shoes, the colour is soft.
I count myself lucky

to have lost my shoes,
still I am wearing some

good shoes. They have been

worn into the floor,
and I am wearing

my shoes — I’m back, I
couldn’t get my shoes out

of my head. I am wearing

a leather jacket
I bought at a store
on the second corner of my street,

the colour’s leather.
My hat sits on the sill.
I pull on my belt
and step into the street

like a child, very iffy.
I walk briskly, jogging
as if I were wearing

older shoes.
I have to pick up my pace

and walk a couple of blocks,
thinking I am walking

too slow, or like I’m running
too fast, or maybe I am wearing

my shoes?
My heart is pounding

like a good, fast runner
in my shoes, running

to catch up to me,
or like I might sprint

for the finish line
and off into the sunset

and I am there,
and I am happy,

what a coincidence
I’ve just made.

I’m running, and I
couldn’t catch

my breath.
Though my heart is
bitter and jittery,

I’m going,
I’m going,

I’m going,
I’m going,

I’ve made
this road,

I’m going.
I’m going,

I’m going.

The Sling of the Unemployed Nation by D. Nurkse

After the shroud of your body lay half-hidden
on the court, it was your turn to pick up the pieces as in the shadows
there were hundreds of all-seeing eyes with a single look on their faces.
Your father, a man with a job who walked across the city
to the prison the year before, who built
a cabin on the crown of some older Russian tree, to be gunned
down into the sky, or hidden in a corner
where he stopped to ask a favor, or be pushed down
like a rag doll.
Bodies with stringy stringy strings
spoke into each other’s mouths,
drifting downward in a long, still line,
but the world giggled at the absurdity of our pain. And for
few, few, was it funny, as for many,
it was profound. The echo of this scene
around the hour that stilled
an entire nation, the pondering of each other’s
attitude toward each other, back to back
as in the mouth of the slave that cried out in pain
has lost its echo and left behind only
the man who cried out in pain,
an American hero, the right man to
lead the rest of the fallen.

I have a heart
that’s
getting bigger
so I’ll sit

like a little child

he’ll lie
at my feet
in the glow of the
I’m holding

and tell me
that it’s okay
to have a heart?

The Beloved by Mary Estélis

When the wind came whee
between my left hip and the rafters,
I imagined a voice saying,
“Beloved, you’re the dead,”
and they were walking across the hall.
I set my books and drawers down,
stopped for dogs, I thought they went
on somewhere else, maybe
the coffee shop.
It was the quiet that mattered,
not the wind or the distance,
though I knew I was going to
die soon. A gruff voice
would come from the stairs,
a hand, a chin, the form
of a face. I picked up the phone,
my father’ll togged his gray to get
me phone service. I didn’t know
who’d be there first. A man couldn’t
speak properly, the stair
couldn’t climb or anyone at the stairs could
but the feeling of not being able
to step into a room could,
we were told, be death.
What if I got paralyzed?
I wanted to know. I carried a backpack
full of books and poems.
I remembered walking across
a street of cars as a kid
in New York, I wanted
to be someone, but wanted
to be somebody who worked
for days on the subway
as an oracle would
do. I want to be a philosopher
and be a chanteuse
of some great song,
but who can sing
the kind of song
that instills fear
in the reader’s heart.
I’ve always loved a song
that says the wrong thing
and ends with a line
about bread.
If I were alive today
I would not want
to have to choose between
two cars
around the corner from my house.
Some day, I’d like to go
from being
a fortunate person
to someone like
an alcoholic,
a homeless person,
a neighbor,
a writer,
or an invalid.

I would like
to be one of
them, and one of
them only.

“Uncle Herb” by Sylvan D. Lawrence

Uncle Herb arrived in Milwaukee
from Philadelphia with a wagon
full of shoes. He told the story
of his uncles
who stayed behind in Philadelphia,
the ones who crossed over
to South Bend, Indiana,
the ones who crossed
over to Chicago, the city
where he had to wear
a filthy undershirt. He’d leave
behind shoes under
a streetlamp, even though
the neighborhood was awash
with shoes
and the streets were thin

and the streets were dirty.
Uncle Herb said he’d never
let his uncles down
in Milwaukee, that he’d
take them back, that he’d
be ready to give
anywhere he got
to the best of his capabilities
if called upon.

Grandma, Mother, Look Out! by Barbara Braida

Grandma, Mother, Look Out!
Look out on this sweet,
fiercely free country
where, for a dollar, you’ll get

a square-cut letterhead five feet high
and a blue skirt five inches wide,
a pair of chinos twelve buttons
and a pair of slacks,

hazelnut-colored sneakers,
chair shoes, fresh socks,
all the things you could never

have before, thanks to
the good people of the United States,
and to the nurses and doctors and marshals who’ve come before
and continue to come,

and all the roadside vendors who’ve come before
for immediate sale or for
a little inspiration,
their shoes, their New Balance,
great Northern hats,
their rags in cuffs, their flats
and knickers, their chapped-up feet
and go-n-go sweaters,
their full-body heavy-duty suits,
for sweat money or because
they love to do it, for
the love of the fight or
the rage to do it,

for the freedom that it gives.

The Last Holiday from Santa Fe by Robert Frost

We stood and talked
About the untutored snow
that had fallen only
a few hours earlier. I
messed once or twice,
and I have always missed
the way you smiled. I
was able to make
some pretty good friends
at the fair. The costumes
I chose were totally
free of radical or Christian ideas.
I was happy every year
when the sun turned
and the winds blew
into my ears. The alleys
were empty of Christmas
dresses and snow. Deer
were nowhere to be found,
just hoof prints on the snow.
I moved from place to place
without thinking twice
before descending
a spiral staircase
arched above my head
up the alleys,
where you once stood,
looking for me,
where else could I be.

The Form of Love by Frances Fox Piven

If for me a good evening, I’ve seen the lights go down, the loo beep, the dogs barking,

I’ve done with the rest of the day, the distractions,

the noise, the long lines of cars, one dog barking,

I’ve had all day, and the table set, I’ve got all

of my life back. I’ve had all day to go to bed,

I’ve had all day too. I’ve had all day to go to bed,

I’ve had all day to go to bed. In the morning I’ve

walked out the door and been a foundress

without shoes, without a coat, without a wig,

having no clothes to wear, I’ve been a woman

I’d never be, who woke the dog,

loved the dog, but powerful dogs have their eye

carefully placed on the woman’s head,

his feet rasping nails, his head buzzing out

screaming for air, after every visit,

how I have been questioned every penny, every hour,

asked every question, every question, every thought,

asked every question, every question,

that God gave me no answers to, but for Love

I have walked out the door without a coat,

without a wig,

without a safe,

after every walk, to the screen of a movie,

I’ve been to bed without a good night's sleep

I’ve been to the movies, I’ve been to bed

without a good night's sleep, and left

night after night, leaving the door ajar,

on a thorough night’s walk,

the road within sight, and the city I’ll never leave

I’ve had all day, and the dogs barking, I’m

not a felt coat, I’m not a handkerchief, I’m

not a rag doll though I know who I am, I’m

I’ve been left a little lonely, I’m not

let me tell you,

I’ve been to bed, in my bed,

without shoes, my bed, the bed

no, not my bed, the bed

I’ve been to the movies and not to bed,

and I’m not a sobriety

I’m not a Dettol either, I

have my doubts, my doubts

I’ve been to bed

but more a conviction, I’ve

washed through some trouble, I’ve been

to bed, I’ve been to bed

but the movies, the dogs barking,

the roads, the stand-up book, the belief,

I’m not left a best, I’m

not where I’ll never be, I’m

not a Dettol either,

I’m not whole

when I’m

angry all day,

sometimes, when I’m about

crazy stuff, I’m in love with

the thing that’s craziest,

not the thing that’s most crazy,

I’m in love with

the thing that’s most

crazy, crazy, crazy,

and I’m not allowed to go

forward, I’m

in the back of the house

with the TV on,

the movies on,

the radio on,

the clothes on.

The Telephone by Edward Thomas

Who will start this?
A man with a black coat;
one who might come from a wood.
Who will touch the button?
A young boy with a big one,
one who might come from a field.
Who will work it?
A woman who might come from a
cattle pasture,
one who might come from
a swamp,
one who might come from
a farmhouse.
Who will run it?
A major, for who?
A woman who might come
from a swan breeding ground.
Who will watch it?
A bald, balding man,
one who might come from
a condor herd.
Who will paint it?
A very lucky man.
Who will do the dirty?
A woman whose job it is
to wash the dishes,
one who might come from
a spaghetti sauce factory.
Who will read it to the kids?
The Tooth Fairy.
Who will eat it?
A very lucky man.

Religion by Peter Campion

Eliza Griswold
The year I came here
from rural Missouri,
there was no one
was standing on the sidewalk.

It is possible
for a person to have a perfect life,
but I am not one of those.

In my pocket, in this pocket
I keep a whip.

I lived as long as I could in the shadow of this table
that knelt in the middle of the road.

I lived longer than when I should have
been able to live myself.

Little Dip by J. Allyn Rosser

He’s seen it slide.
As you drove him to the highway block
where he was waiting, he’d waved.
He’d stopped to take the light
from the cigarette while you drove
your children back to high school.

He’d doubted you as a driver
to be able to make it home
that afternoon, with hair short
and black and unkept, not depressed
at all. But here you were,
in this dark gray, and not afraid.

He waited. He watched
as you pulled over, and he came to the
door, and the door opened.
He sat down, and he lit a cigarette.

He said something about taking care
of everyone else, and he smiled
and said, “Good luck.”

The Spider-Rent by Donald Hall

They came with the tide,
spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders—
spiders and spiders.

And the spiders
bundled themselves
down under the sea.

Then the spiders
wrote out history.

It was a sad story.

The tide came out.

They wrote out history,
spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders.

The tide came out.

Spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders.

Pulling the spiders out
they started to build
a tent, a spider-
site on the ocean.

The tide came out.

The tide came out.

They went in with the tide,
spiders and spiders,
spiders and spiders.

And the spiders
 wrote a history
with their own bums.

Pulling the spiders out,
the spiders wrote their history
with their own bags.

The tide came out.

Finally, in the news: China o’er the Bay Bridge by Bryan D. Harper

Finally, in the news: China o’er the Bay Bridge.
I see my mom walking

New York, 1961 by Marjorie Agosín

St. John the Baptist, 1944

On account of some thrust,
I’ve come to an understanding with myself:
Not to run away from anyone;
A song I’ve written
will be sung anyway.

The sidewalks, the parks, the maids’ rooms,
the people, our money, love,
the fears, the frustrations,
we’re all one experience, it might get old.
So I’ll take up welding and pick up a book.
A laundromat, a subway, the beat-up old ladies’ clothes
from a corner a block away. In the morning,
I’ll wake to a new city,
a city of so many names,
a city whose streets, streets,
are not named after birds or flowers,
or the creaking of soap stools.

I’d like to stay in my old life,
save for some complicated task,
and go do it myself.
It’s not hard to learn to fly a plane.
If only I could talk my way through a divorce.
If only I could learn to give myself over completely—
that is, to ignore the fundamental needs
of my life,
and simply live for others.

Which brings me, once again, to my wife:
with her eyes
open, she’s reading
a story about a wise man
whom God wills never to return,
and she reads it with me,
and we walk down a deserted street,
little old man with his wings
down, little old man with his wings
up,

and I am obviously very sorry
if I have suddenly become a terribly old man
and she must learn how to hold me.

Two Roads by Walter Savage Landor

— Henry Garrett

A woman, kneeling, goes in search of a child,
And her child, afraid of the woman,
Is bowed in prayer and kisses her hand.

And two cows, one and two, come
And sit in the pewter table, and their
Cows are all fair and jade, while I
Sit on my comfy chair and listen to her
Singing happily the way a woman
Sings happily the way she does.

I know this, but I am not surprised,
Besides the gentle drifts in the air,
The AIR IS SO GOOD THAT I DO NOT
Feel the need to clean it up or anything.
It is so good that I don’t even stand
Up for a minute. I hear a familiar voice
But it is my own, her voice and my own,

The clock ticks, the tide drops, the snow melts.
It’s twilight and I am almost
Home, I am almost there already, I’m almost

Arriving I guess this is a song about
Getting there, but it is really
About the weather, it is about the weather

Being the wrong kind of weather and
Being so cold, being so cold.

The Viscount by Ding Lu

We cut our knees
on the st. promenade — silence —
did we not read for laughs — my father’s
motorized stroller, her hands
on his car, his back
i-beam. He was huge

and the paper was shaking,
I finally understood how

he was able to carry
grains

the way I had
already done,

with my entire body

on the pavement, brushed against
big shoes,

without knowledge
we had awkward

communions
to the Old Testament,

to my mother. Where

was her, I asked.
A thin wire
poured from the roof

of the carriage.

Listen to the Babes by Rita Dove

Convince me. I am the one who’ll take the jeep
And run for cover.

I’d like a better life,
A family, a comfortable home,

Whether I’ll live a long time or not.

Be sure to bring me something delicious.

I’ll be riding the tiger, hell-bent
On accomplishing my own end,

Criticize the status quo,

Think I deserve it,

Rock my skull,

Run to my death,

Be the one looking over my shoulder
As I slip into traffic.

Listen to the Diaries by Linda Donnelly

The mother sits up
The night before her daughter
The father sleeps

We talk of her hair.
The father hands.

They are the survivors
Of a war he survived.

There is the rub,
The backbone.

Here is the war.

In between
Is the future.

The last few bars
Are the earth’s songs.

They are the history
Of one who sings.

I listen to the beat:
A lion at the edge of a dry spring.

Lightning flashes across a dark.
A dark cannot hide:

I can see the water
Or a river, its banks split.

I can hear the roar
Of the ocean
Or the roar of a river

swaying by the moon.
I can feel the spinning.

A feeling of weightless things.
Here is the past.

Here is the future.

I was not baptised by Henry Terry

◆◊

The stench of yesterday's crisp eyeglasses,
the smudge of ski-slicked feet, the scrape
of a postage stamp, so the people asked my name.

The corrugated waistcoat, short, tucked into the waist
of my trousers, made the people gasp.

A well-tailored shirt, worn more than once,
a pair of sandals of the right length,
a pair of sandals that left marks
where the right heels used to be,
where the seatbelts had been,
where windows had been rolled up,
all of the stuff that we had to do.

When I came to bed, my slats were so tight
I could barely lift my head and my mouth was trying
to speak, my words were coming out like footsteps
or knocks or thuds or slaps of the foot.

I had left my address and my phone
in the car, I had forgotten my password.

I had left my keys in the car.

I had forgotten my street.

Even yesterday I’d taken a train,
not the one I would take today,
which was clear of trains, only a line
or two. Now the train seemed so long
and wide and empty, the traffic light
was nonexistent, I didn’t know where I was
since I’d never been to this part of town
and I was tired of wandering
all over it tomorrow, wandering
to the library where my name was on the index,
and looking up at the sky,
meeting my face,
and reaching across my mouth to make
a beautiful sound I had never heard,
raising my voice to a level the people
could hear and believing.

Childhood by Matthew Rohrer

The shape of my interstices
shall speak toward the future—
I’ve carved including­­ heads
of burly plants, flowers and
the fuzzy sprouts of spider mites;

I’ve practiced up to and
through the night to climb
in my father’s Cadillac
and turned back to the sun
in the dark, my eyes fixed
on the stars in the sky,

I wavered—
then I said,
“I’ll stay,”
to the sound of clouds rumbling
above the Rio Grande
and a twig snapping
in the wind, the rumbles and
thumps of horses trotting, the
pop of building chimneys, the howls,
the snows of horses
milling in the long grasses.

And this day, in the end,
I stood alone
at the top of the stairs
and lifted my hat—
I’ve been up there
all my life.

Song for My Young Lover by William Blake

For my lover I am writing now
Because you’re dead.
The fall of a glass over a footbridge is all that matters
To me. It’s not your fault I’m dead.
That’s the trouble with love. He falls for me
Even though he’ll end up dead. And so it’s true:
I’m dying too. So.

I am writing now because this is wrong
And I don’t know a thing about love.
I’ve tried it once with a bear,
The neighbor girl who lives just down the road.
He said she was beautiful, but I told him
I hadn’t done anything with a bear.
He said:
“That’s what kids do.”

Wood by Emma Lazarus

Page

the only wand of the wood
I make,
the only thimble of the wand
made of wood,
the bow like a cane
with a sound like cannon shells
shot into the sky,
I make.

The rickshaw pulls on the tail of the bow
and the silk pulls on the rickshaw
all bends beautifully in a circle around the white desk.

I’ve walked in the wood for as long as I can remember.
The long hair hangs down
like a broken arm. The face is unattractive
and at the center a tremendous pride
and sweetness shines inside.

I walk past the rickshaw on its journey,
through the light,
and go to the back of my mind
and lock the door.

It is impossible to cut the grass

with the same sad
burden

in the heart. One foot
crosses the threshold
and the other steps
follow.

The grass is on the threshold
but apparently it has grown

too hot, too cold.

Laua Storm by Lisa Wells

The black-cockaded gulls, in the year-round sky
are very visible every night in plain view of the house
and town. The shingle roofs creak at the edges perhaps,
but at the same time bear the understory.
Even the fish that live in them poke their heads
at the unassuaged coffee tables. In the center of the town
there is a plaza where the old jukebox
has been turned into a tea house where the young people come
to listen to clarion guitars and hear old-time reggae,

to just relax under the water-painted sailboat
or to stop at the picnic table, to pick up
a cold water bottle and some dirty socks, to feel
like a big brother or a big sister, or both.
You have to be careful not to hit the chair
or the sink or the alarm wire, or the icebox,
or your own beans, or yourself.
You have to be careful not to hit your own
coming home from the park or the gym,
or your own midnight show, or your own

convent in which you were sheltered from the terror
of the everyday: the sudden running to get your clothes
and your shoes and your suitcase, your hair comb
and your braided ponytail, your cheap toothbrush,
until it all traces of your tin-boss idle whispers
into your ear until it all becomes:
“I’ll be back.”

The Executioners, Mountain. by Leslie Pono

They came out of the woods, carrying
bodies. They were not wearing snow-
covering coats, they were bare-headed.
They had mauled the remains of deer
and buffalo, mutilating their selves.
They had cut into the old man’s horse’s hide
and eaten it whole—slaughtered it.
The river snakes, the road
grids. These young men were on their way
to a town that used to be mine,
a place where men were
supply-stressed, a house that had been
finished but had been dragged
into a tunnel-like hole dug through rocks
and roots, a cemetery where a séance
was held in the yard.
The sand-haired initiates
dressed in snow and white, to go along
in their blood-spattered
gear. They carried the skulls
of the old, askew, polar bears,
beaver skulls, or the bones
of the newly slaughtered
bucket-headed bear.
They were not hunting,
they were shooting

from a safe distance
as the old man kept shooting
until the stone was bled on
by the old man’s own bullet.

A Slow Life by Elizabeth Bear

In the wake of the dawn,
nothing is
full of preconditions.

There’s only
so much energy
to do what needs doing
and no need to rush

to judgments or orders
conferring with your
face off. Because
the reply to your question
is a phone call
waiting to be answered.

You are silent.
The sun
will not be up
any moment
but its noise and the flood

will be there
when you need it.
And stories will follow—

the tentative illusion
of you
pulling yourself together
to go back home
when you need to

and people will be
like you
every day

and the world will
be as it is now
or it will be

more like it is
when you have been
and not
much has changed

The God of Suckers by Sir  Thomas Wyatt

Do you know, sir,
That nowadays

Who, when he’s angry
I scold him?

And for good reason,
That’s what I’m used to.

Do you know, sir,
That lately,
I’ve been looking

At things,
And now I’m thinking

Of things that I need?

And I’ve told you,
In a loud voice,
That I’m afraid

Of my god,
And, because I tell me

Not to love him,
So he gets angry.

And as I told you,
‘They’re once more poking
Their wounds at me,

The God of Suckers
Scolds me,
‘Don’t you ever love me!

Doesn’t this sound like a fun story,
To you, sir,
If you’re talking to me?

What is fun is wearing a t-shirt
And dancing.

This is to get you treated the way you want.

The God of Suckers
Wears a really sad face.

The God of Suckers
Is the one who loves you when you treat him.

And so,
Once more,
I’m getting to grips
With this ‘sort of  love’.

Your god sucks
And’s pissy.

He’s a lame beggar.
He’s a pusillanimous,
Sunken cowboy.

He’s a loon.
He’s a wading bog.

He’s the squaw who sucks
And’s pissed off.

He’s a “friend” at heart.
Just like you and I, he’s’a boring all-knowing jerk.

He’s just like you.
He’s not a very nice guy.

Manhunt by Kimberly Parko

The kindhearted, gentle,
technological genius, who would save your life.
You might call him your friend,

the presidential kind,
a deep thinker, who would listen
to your pleas for mercy,

and who never forgot
your endless gratitude
for all the love you've shown
till he lay living

on a disabled person's kitchen table
days filled with hot meals,
etched in a terrible skillet
of a grinder.

A Man by John Ashbery

The Tobias by Léonie Adams

In the air the boy picks up his speed
And trots along the highway with his hat
Pulling the plug for the first time,

Knocking over parked cars
Smacking the pavement with his shoe
Kicking the sand out like a speck
Of particles

The boy tries to keep up
But his feet are bound to collapse

He must push on, pull on his gait

He knows that nothing
Will work, but he has to try

Because the girl’s life
Is too short and precious to waste
And she ain’t got no life

In hotels or restaurants
Or in any other routine

So the boy pushes on,
Keeps going, keeps going,
Shots the brakes, pushes this tire

Down the driveway, skids through a brick wall.
What happened to him? And what was his reaction?

What can the boy do now
To help a girl who’s stuck

In traffic in Philadelphia,
Or stuck on a train in New York City?

The Lonely and Lonely by Donald Revell

A feather as beautiful as a parrot’s need

Is my morning and my morning, like my bird,

Is my voice that I’reed to call my own

And my man. The music of my voice

Is a joy to me that there’s not a bird

That might find the bird if it dares.

Would I had not caught the bird

Even if I had been more beautiful

I would not.

Mockingbird by Richard Kenney

My mother hasn’t seen a mockingbird in years.
She’s sure it’s grown inside her.
She’s amazed it’s stray-proof.
What might it be? a bird that doesn’t look like a mockingbird but has many other features that make it resemble one?
I’m not sure.
Where exactly does it have to go before it’s special?
I know it’s a curious bird.
But does it have a name?
Do mockingbirds have families?
I won’t know for years until I meet one.

From the Flat by Jorge Luis Borges

Snow raining down

No one cares,
the trees are too big,
themselves too poor,
they’re out of date.

A Manifest by Suzanne Buffam

The milk
of young bodies
caught in the cold
stooping between lines
hear the quiet cry
of children
in hell or in the air

all that is discarded
or never quite enough
under the windows
by the cold
cheap mirrors
in alleyways
a thin column
of lights
a slow whirl

a hug
the world
under your feet

and light
like the starry sky

make notes
of rocks
of trees
of streets

with the pale line
of a lower shelf
of kids
under the pages

so you see
the world as being
almost always
a long way
from places
where you had
not even known
that peaceful
is not always
peaceful

although the dreams
of the silent
night have a way
to move us,
not to be
abandoned in the streets
where miles
of tracks are
blowing past
when
you’re
there

The Schoolyard Dresses by Chard DeNiord

Once, I was dressed in sharp-toed shoe heels.
In the schoolyard there are no frills.

I slipped from heels. I slid off
a high-collared dress.

I was soaked with sweat.
I opened the door and saw
all my backpacks piled in the closet.

I was terribly embarrassed.

The principal shared how shaggy

petals spread like hairs on a rabbit;

I burst out laughing and ran

to my room shouting, "What the hell!
What was that sound??"

All over the schoolyard

I could hear the principal's laughter,

the whole schoolyard was laughing,

the principal's giggles,

we shared a laugh.

Canticle by Lorna Dee Cervantes

I was with one of the circus performers in the dark
Nights, one of the voices, when the stranger started
A hackneyed march

He drew the curtains and then we
Were suddenly the neighbors,

The trace of a butter knife
Lingered like the moon

On the kitchen table
Lucas and I
On the lawn as merry

Wounded, dazed by laughter

I stood there,
As if I’d always been there,

A thousand women, each hugging the man
Till I could’t move.

Some were crying,
I have no idea what it was

The Last Tango by Romaine Barry

Grandma, when the ricewine
cracked with neon heads
flies, the crepe was
mean and made of clover root,

then a sweet, sweet,
sweet, I mean lemongrass
sprouted on the kitchen table
and developed into a meal

of rice, platters, and bands
of beaded cloth, women’s girdles,
anywhere they turned, flowers knotted,

flowers, flowers again
chapped in the arms of a child
with a little pink hair,

the color and the shape
of a small, furry bell,
at first I thought of the
much smaller bell of a cat,

but it needed
the power and the knowledge
to be powerful and to be beautiful.

Sleeping at the End of My Shift by Manuel Jin

When I tell you that I am dreaming,
I’ve made a promise to myself—
that I’ll undress before dawn,
take my shoes off,
give my coat to the dog.

But when I tell you that I’m dreaming,
I’ve made a promise to you—
that I’ll undress in a field
of snow, spit on my own feet—
that I’ll have to draw a line
through the field of snow
to get to the bed.

When I tell you that I’m dreaming,
I’ve made a promise to you—
that I’ll undress in the dark,
whom I’ve never let out
into the light.

The Gun-Barrel by Arthur Symons

For once in my life, I paid a lot
Out of my delusive money to hear
A glass of beer sing, a walk
Up a hill to the boat house

Only to be disappointed. It was
Absurd as a bear cub was
Responsible for making me

Never get back in the station
The carriage just pulled off

After the largely empty spot
You can imagine, the one
Who pulled it was the driver

For once in my life, I paid a lot
Out of my delusive money to hear
The wind of a new train blow

This time, I've got no fear on my face
I know the tracks, and the stations

I walk past now I have no fear
The lights are on, the carriages

Are moving, and the cars parked behind
The rails, all that excitement

Lenses on a dark room where I'm back
While the train is moving through the dark

One time, the horse caught in the pit
The wrong way, spring was

On the horizon, the Great Lakes were sky blue
One time, I said hello to a cowboy

The train comes along, nothing is said
I don't want to go any further

I'm sleepy or something, who am I?

How I Learned to Spare by Terese Svoboda

With glass sloped
on the earth's surface, and a ladder
tarted to the side, and a hand in
the air to grind the earth, I am
unable to walk across the stage
without a good mother’s love
or the ear to whisper
“Chonnam je"”

for the first time.
The laughter’s too high now
in the long distance, and I am unmoved.
And the family sits
where the stove is kept warm,
and the candles are kept in the attic.
And the wine is kept in the cellar.

And the blade I sold
has not been returned to its owner.
And I am not sure if the great
katala tree I planted
survived, or died.

with your voice
in the ear of that elephant
lifting, but still and
rock at the heart of
trees,
carving,

the needles
nailed until they
are soched in soft
silk pale wash
of a brown carpet,

sodden glass,
tangled wire,
chipped paint
in a pocket
tilted to one side
of a living room
of chimneys;

kingless,
carpeted foot’s
shoaling rug of needles
gaps and splits,
limbs of windows
waste their light
on tiny strings
of smoke
from the east
of the trees,

from the east
of the trees,
from the east

Herbert by Denise Levertov

when I first came to the south I asked
Mother to write a book about the war.
She didn’t know what it was called.
I kept asking, how many pages? ten? four?
she said, I don’t know either.
When I later told Mother about the old lament
from the south that the books were being burned,
she was angry.

Two years later, after I left for college
and after I lost half of my money,
Mother went home and I followed.

Though half of the poems included addressed to me,
and a day after my disappearance
I returned from college to see my mother dead,
what I had hoped I’d find in my old books
was missing from my new library,
it was not a disorder I heard about for years.

There was a white paper instead,
a scan of a book not owned by me.
I didn’t read it, though I now look
back on that day fondly.

I have dreams of me stumbling down
a great staircase, covered in snow,
and falling from the heights of the library
where I was being taught
how to read the minds of the dead.

I have dreams of me standing
in a great hall, and then
looking up and seeing
no one, only myself in the
walls of reflection.

for All the People by Frank Stanford

You can't go back. You can't
wait until the sun sinks. You can't
drown in the cosmic miseries of a hired
steps, sunlight scanning the tree
ahead of you. The words of love
the words of trust, once written, float
through the framework of the mind, making
a knife fight, a tennis elbow, a walk through
a field of light. If you've ever
abandoned an idea or two, if
the fence of fear you've erected
is still a trysting fawn that signals
a feigned love for a what has been,
that workforce still ploughing out
one foot into the ground,
this crumpled book of twelve
bedside chronicles of blissful ignorance.
You can't go back. You can't
wait until the sun sinks. You can't
suffer the dirty thoughts, the tedious
black-armored names, the middle-class
privilege, or the sudden distractions
of cable and internet. You can't return.
Like mindlessness, chicken--and-egg,
lapdog, or dog-eat-dog,
the walking dead, or the few who survive,
what you need to do is lift
your head, bend over, and listen.

The Missal by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

God let the sparrows by the window-sill blow continually ringing
Like a distant bell, and among them, Dory and Herrmann,
Forgetting her care for the moment, stooping and kissing

The sink eye-level, and speaking[blank] into the microphone.
My heart’s a world, and the world’s a place of roses.
Where will we go the day, the time of day, the place
Where light is a cell? We will be there.

On the highway
Or on a desert road, the grooves
Of my life, the sight of which I’ve tried to forget,
When did that happen, how did that happen then?

◈Top of the World by Claude Noel

I can hear the goddess turning up in a panic
tense as she approaches the Statue of Liberty
at the wharf of the old Fort Hamilton
nearly half the continent’s capitol city.

She is a woman in a green robe,
thirty feet high and seven feet long.

She is shouting “Retire earlier,”” and half of America
innocently bends over the parapet

and gives up their decades of polite
temperament, pretending to have nothing to do
with the man in the pajamas

in the corner of that apartment
with SUVs filled with suitcases and precious metals.

They are just staring out the windows
at the night sky that’s still the same color

as the brick that was once their own place
which has been rented and is now the ground

so sharp and pure and entirely illuminated
with an eerie twinkle that’s the color of a face

that’s wearing sunglasses, a face that’s not there anymore.

The Widow by Guillaume Apollinaire

Two nights before our confrontation
I had hoped to perform
a wonderful manoeuvre….My veil
was about to fall.
The wind was light, cool. The rain
came.

Behind the garden wall
the blinds were drawn.
When I tried to walk
under the windows,

I was told they were
closed. in Greece,
a widow is supposed to wear
a white gown
and veil
and, in Romans,

be alone.
Do I know the name of the house
where they lived?

I know some people are born
to live at the ends of the earth
but I know
that's not how it works.

When I look at photographs
I know those who are
genetically predisposed
to live at the ends of the earth.

I know I have to move
but I hate to leave
a house I love.

Maybe my house is not as fair
as it seems.
Let me call you
a kind of whore.

The night has left a familiar shape in my heart,
a place, a name, a funeral,

like the hush of a city built
on gap year or the empty fields

of a previous life

where I want to live, always

even beyond the scope of my past
and its risk

even though I never wanted to be

even if I could walk across

even on a wall

to do it yourself,
even if it was a desert

and all I can do

is sit and wait

She goes outdoors, to a meadow.

She smiles, and I am certain from her

A dream that nothing will ever be the same.

The War of the Worlds by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

A world of twinkling stars
Flares up in narrow lines,
Hungering for the ever-glinting skies.

Pieces of the moon
Couldn’t contain the swarm of bees,
Wind, waves, cars and the high winds.

Nothing gleams on a bed of broken glass,
A long night, wind out the window,

The moon, the night, the day, the night.
A world of passing cars
Or hover, gliding undetected.

Near the lake
No odors gather so quickly,
The darkness is less dense,

The trees, the cow-milk dream,
The wood, the relics of the past.

Nothing sparkles, sparks, lights, or glows,
Till, as I push a thin knife
Into the air, a voice sings a song I know.

that leads to another life.

The door is locked.
I’m bound to fall

to the next room.
My car is still in drive,
it’s locked. I’m home.
I’m downstairs

where the stove is on low,
I’m on the staircase
that leads straight to the balcony
on my bed
where I can watch the sunset
while I’m on my way home.

had a dream
of slavery and stars.

The Polish-Lithuanian Orthodox Arch Kleil Foca
was fried at the Philadelphia Orchestra,

from Pittsburgh, from Newcastle,

from Harlem, from Michigan—
from Brooklyn,

from abreger’s feet
his beautiful face

was blasted
from the air of Austerlitz
by the Mass in St. Petersburg

and the crowd surged
all the way to Vienna
where they began

to sing
what’s on

shoes of the vanquished
from the heights of the Kremlin

the Poles were back and
moving through the night

were bleeding rich

And it is. I will leave

The best and the best. I'm sure my friends will

mattress. And his thick-limbed foot

in the dust.
All these are
far removed from each other

not far from each other.

Last night I stepped

behind the door
of his house

and saw him pedaling away

to the motel.
He’s coming back

to reclaim his town,
his prairies,

his land,
his original sin,

his crime.
And all these roads,

all these roads,

his own words,
his fears, his karma,

are all also roads,

a way to get from one place

The Exchange by Rebecca Wolff

You are out on the hills when

a landscape with a thousand secrets.

leaves behind a vine. Pale raspberries
bare the moon. The world is one
where shadows are the colors of a man’s
face and a woman’s hand. One
where you have to be quick and considerate
of the little ones. One where a man
knows what the gift of a journal
