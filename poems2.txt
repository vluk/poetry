The Lion by Ralph Waldo Emerson

The lion is not well fed;
He is very thirsty.
I hear he is very angry,
And if he is very angry,
It means he must eat.

And he is very unhappy,
Are you sure?
I heard a man say.
This is a very sad tale.

The lion eats.
He grows fat.
He becomes stout.
He wastes away.
He marries.
The lion is very handsome.
The lion is very well fed.
The lion is very thirsty.

Glow-A-Dot by May Swenson

A rose's glory
is fading, and so is
the day it blooms.

Look how far
this is from
a nether town.

Look how low
the Easterling
stands in a crowd.

One is not just
a lump, but
a face—

a form
of life that can't
stand in the
laundry.

Someone has
taken life

so far.

But how

can you

let it

get away with

this? I

ask myself
every morning,

where is the light
in the sky?

If I had a nose
and a mouth
and a nose and
a tooth,

would I have
a nose?

And would the

"Deplorables"
still

take a stand
?

So many of
us’s sons—

the

pigs, the

The Painted Lily by Gwendolyn Brooks

Each thing in the garden is painted
with a different color — the pink gingerbread
dough, the white house, the purple rugs.

Every day my sister wakes to find
the walls painted with all
the pretty colors I can find.

I love the way the rain
flats against my window
and the way the leaves gather
and bud as if under a sway.

It's like someone I love
has a heart like a monkey — the way
the rain rugs the porch,

the house, the trees, the garden.
It's love and giving
and more than giving

and more than giving.

Night Flight by Frank Stanford

Over the city, we stand,
forty or fifty feet ahead of the air

that in its full thickness,
loosens, and everything rushes,

and we bar the door, shout
up into the night. Our bodies

are still wet with the emotion
that has washed over us,

and we have not yet lost the sea.

The wind howls miles away, like a long
straight line, and we know

that somewhere in the sky

someone is watching us,
waiting for us to join the rest

of the plane, or the rest of the passengers

that sit down at the back of the plane

and wait for the day to pass.

The Ship
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Rebecca Wolff

In your dreams, in your kisses,
plus her crib
the ship
arises,

the long one
on the far side

of the boat
with a range of sails and

the huge one on the
lean-to bottom

which has a whole

of cinnabar
and the other

scarab-like
sail-shaped
in that it

can be raised

and lowered
and I am afraid

to ride it,
to steer it

toward the stars,
toward the next

day, to the one

next week
and to the one

last night,
toward the end of it

till it bursts

and you are left
with nothing but

the slanting curve
of the stern
and the slanting

abandoned iron
crudely

legible.

In the Wake of a Storm by D. Nurkse

In the wake of a storm, in the wake of a tsunami
the south tall buildings fall
on the shocked ground.

In the wake of a tsunami
the car rests on its roof.

In the wake of a tsunami
God opens his arms and the earth
becomes a water-covered space, a sea of water,
a palace of the sea.

In the wake of a tsunami
waters puddle on the sidewalk
and the train well’s rails puddle on the sidewalk.

In the wake of a tsunami
a man moves out of the house, walks on the
shallow zone, walks on the street,

takes a picture of you.
Jasmine tea floats on the seawater's surface.

In the wake of a tsunami
a girl reaches on the seawater’s surface,
pulls herself up the stairs.

In the wake of a tsunami
the colored glass floats on the water.

In the wake of a tsunami
a man tries to touch the glass in his shoes.

The Angel by Hester Knibbe

We wanted to feel familiar
for one of the most painful things in our life.
We wanted to be protected
from the unexpected
that comes suddenly and often.

But when we first arrived
in this country, we were only
worth a visit.

We wanted to look
like ordinary people,
but the place we wanted to live
was so remote and difficult.

We wanted to be
a real house.

Flying into a trance
like we were going into another country,
we took off our shoes.

We wanted to go back
to a time before television,
before telephones.

I wanted to dress
like a woman.

With my sister
I could do it all,
but my sister
was afraid
of heights.

I wanted a man
to be afraid.

My sister
knew how to behave
in a house.

It was her reputation
that got me there.

My sister
was one of the bravest girls
in the world.

At the Shops by Tony Hoagland

After a week at the shops
we get home and go to bed.

Our minds, immense shops,
are only sprawled on our couches

and the dusky stairwells stare

back to us, seeing us pass.

We have lighted dinner
on our glass doors

while the coffee

is hot and full of life.

We are wrapped in our coats
and hangers of peanuts

and box after box of candy,

all the weeks and all the gifts,

the teeth-gritted, the "You’re welcome,
the snow-white room, the candy bar"

we have relished in,

the positive and the cheap

we have demanded

from the world because we know

we are only all dreaming

when I turn on the radio,

I hear music:Singing

of the wild and the beautiful

only a few miles away.

A Sorrowful Life by David Baker

I could not live
the life I had in mind.

I was never
thinking of that house
in Hamden
where you are staying

where you were born
in the 1920s,

my grandfather
and I were never
in this world
that we lived in

his house
that he had
built

and the shade,
the air, the air
of a thousand miles

and still I could
not live
the life that I had
in mind.

Even now I’m wishing
I had never

married this man.
Even now I’m wishing

I had never
born this girl.

And I’m really glad
it was
not me

I was born into this world
or some short-lived one

like me,
but for the good
and not for any

advantage that my life
had afforded me.

The bad part was
the bad part.

But you know
what you’re going to do

You wander in a Land where you

You are the Piece of the Puzzle
that makes the whole army of listeners

that is Night’s Dwelling,


a woman, by a Road
made of Crows, a man,
by a river, a dove,

a girl, the song is sung
like a sad song, like a Hymn

singed by a Hymn Choir,

with the cane

in a Land you’re not a member of,
where you don’t belong,

you’re alone, you ’re the one
who’ll come back.

If a Fable Be Not
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Robert W. Service

Right after the war, I heard a song
I’ve never heard in my life. It was April and I wasn’t
in New York, but in Pennsylvania, a suburb
of Philadelphia, and I was staying with a friend.
That’s how I learned about the band
that played in a bar in Harrisburg, where I was living
as a taxidermist, and how, even now,
when I’m driving to the grocery store,
I pull out my "If a fairy be not"
toting the ends of the car,
so that I may take the loaf of bread in my mouth.

It’s not fair to say that I’ve never heard
the song, the one about the fairy and the rock,
the one about the child who awakens
and is a million miles away and is a house.
Maybe it’s the way the song plays in the car,
and I’m imagining it, or maybe I’m not.

Mexico.

I could

have been out

all night

in the sun

and not been

sad.


And the night

is coming on again

with a rasp,

a raspy noise

that’s unmistakeable in the distance.

There’s no

other way to say this.

I know even now

it’s the dream

of a baby

that gets me.

I know even now

it’s the dream

of a black

baby that gets me.

I know even then

that’s nothing

to be ashamed of

and nothing to be ashamed.

I know even then

that’s nothing to be ashamed

Recess by Lawrence Ferlinghetti

Missing nothing, I get up
and walk up to the school
with homework and pencil,

and if anyone ever gets mad
I just can’t tell.

Miss House, I’m not
tall enough yet to carry it.

I sit here for hours
writing down everything,

I’ve just learned to read
my mind, the alphabet,

the shape of faces.

If I don’t learn
I’ll be the dumb

student who forgot
the name of the cat
a week before the bell

clipped, never got
his homework,

or couldn’t spell
the name
or the year.

Miss House, I’m
certain about this:

I’m the weird one,
looking for a home,

I’ve never been to
a movie,

I’ve never been
to an elementary

camp,
and if I ever
leave here,

I’ll never
know if it’s
the same place.

For a Little Beatitude by John Keats

One child that I have to leave behind;

Who, when I wake up, I will never
Leave my house again.
But when I visit you, I will not
Leave my house again.

The Unborn (1977) by Michael Chitwood

I was walking across the highway in Wisconsin
and I saw an old man with [a gun]
in his mouth leaning over
the same old bench. Looking at him
I said “Look, they’re shooting
at the baby in the crib;” and

I had just seen that movie
“Unborn,” in which a black woman
was born on our own street
on a Saturday,
and a few hours after that
a couple came to pick her up
and I was standing in the doorway of the car with her
and I said “Look, they’re shooting” and

I thought, “Well, that’s what happens when
you try to go over night with a pistol
in your fist,” and I didn’t come,
but that night the baby was mine
and the fetus
was the child’s.

At the Mountain's Edge by Edward Thomas

Because the mountain
Is in the water’s way,
God took it from the earth
And placed it on the clouds’
Floor; that is,
A stone eternity
To which we are all reduced.

Why is it that the sea
Is higher than God’s hand?

And why doesn’t the mountain
Profit its place in the sky
? On this earth, the sea
Is anvil by which to strike out
A land of meaning, a heaven to shout
For the things God wants?

When we look at the world
Butting against the hillside
We’re reminded of the mountain
And the sea’s boundless
Into which our lives may continue

When we see the miracles
Of a man and a fish
Who swim fast
Because they know the secrets
Of eternity.

By the Sea by John Tipton

I love to ride a tide rising
and flood a portico.
I love to drink the waterfall
of light on a skeletal head
or the rippled waves
of a mother's neck
or a man's loosened pants
and give the grandparents a scare
that they’ll be alright.

Sometimes, I love to watch a light
like a bobcat standing on a fence
and twitch in the dark of a train.
I love to watch the waves
of a woman’s raveling knee
or a man’s t-shirt
cussing his underwear.
I love to imagine the sunset
where the waves rise and fall
and look down upon
the Blue Ridge and the sea
that lifts and swings
all day long.

And I love to be a kid
and sit beside a boat
and feel the light
of a moon on a trees—
I love to look up at the horizon
and see the blue
of the sky, the moon
with its cute little eyes,
and feel its heat.

that I’m there and on my own.

And I’m going to be fine,
or she, if I bring

there will be no other

there, so I shall be
fine, or him, if I bring

look good and strong, and eager

Half of the time I’d like to work, I’m overwhelmed

But the blind girl knows

High Plains by Larry Levan

A mountaineer strives
back from a snowfield
to a village of tents,
wrestling his way
up goshen and prairie
glacial ridges, demanding
he be the one to climb
or descend. Each time he does
this, he’s reminded
of his own indecision,
of how he’ll never be
the one to do it.

It’s the  high point
of his day, when
he’s the one
currying favor
from the town,
or the inn,
or the limousine
or the car he’s driving.
Silent, the sky
blocks the view.

A woman’s swinging
from the air
as if dancing

What is the difference

The Day After (and After) by John Bush

I cry when I see a house in decline,
baby-boomers who have forgotten the pleasures
of small-town life, the old oak trees

and redwood shrubs, and the new cornfields;
I cry when I see the upholstery worn

and dirty and dirty, the carpet too dark
for my body, the garbage cans

and the porcelain cupboards dirty with rust.
I cry when I see my mother drive

an hour north, back to Philadelphia
to a van with a sign on the side

all about the economy saying, “Get Home
for Your Baby, Pick up Your Stuff, and Don’t

Meet in a Parking Garage,” I cry when I see

my daughter driving an hour north,
driving a truck in the rain, and crying

when I see her driving an hour south,
on her way to meet her sister,

and her driving an hour north to meet her son
I cry. I cry when I see the trash

coming to the curb, the old clothes drying
on the shelves, the shoes and socks

which not only will never be clean, but
I’ll never wear anymore.

Day of Infant Loss by Barbara Ehrenreich

At my death, I have nothing to do

like a weightless voice and
beautiful hands and the ability

to float above the rubble
and feast on a seaweed boiled

in a slow-cooked pot, to read
the passage of smoke

through the window, the words
of anguish inside

the bodhisattvas that have yet to
be called a day,

like the two propane tanks
I see me one day filling,

all the words of my father
and the friends he left behind

on this quiet, day and all
hoped for, my own life.

Thy wealth and honour lie in laureles,

The moulded joy that lies in thy youth;

My subservient wealth and honour
Lies with thy blood and love!

The gift of thy obedience
To this secret will has flow
And set thy way to glory;
Thy wealth and honour lie in laureles

The race of horses that trods,
The moulded joy that lies in thy youth;
But like a slaveholder's fancies
My subservient wealth and honour
Lies with thy blood and love!

Lethargic by Judith Ortiz Cofer

The first time I rode the train,
I sat at a booth,
I drank Dom Pérignon
in my car,
I ate pancakes
in my car,
I slept in the car,
I brought home
the leg of a friend
that hadn’t been stolen
or burned.

I think about the color of your hair,
the way you point
a finger in the breeze,
your smile when I walked in,
and the way
you smiled
from the doorway when I left.

I’ve never had a hungry room,
nor the feeling of being cheated,

nor was I ever hungry,
I was only hungry
when I’d had a long evening —
I’ve only ever had
lack of energy,
no stamina,

and I can’t remember the last time
I sat alone
for an interesting conversation,
or the second time
I’m going home
I think about the way
I walk,
the way I collect
the things I should have bought,
and the way
I put them all in my suitcase,
and sat to think about
the next trip,

and the way I stayed
goodnight.

Beauty by Christopher Buckley

Beneath a badger’s tail
the sea air smells of runway

and the carcass of a bus
the wind blows against the wall

the wind is a weight
and the town is the line

the villagers are gone and the stars
are black and orange and that’s jest

I hear a man muttering but I don’t see
the man with the wind in his hair

and my aunt say she has a tendency to fix

the sky with her eyes

the wind blows against the wall

Beneath a badger’s tail
the sea air smells of runway

and the carcass of a bus
the wind blows against the wall

ghosts of the village hang here and there

and this’s jest

the wind blows against a wall

and the wind is a weight
and the villagers are gone and the stars

are black and orange and that’s jest

I hear a man muttering but I don’t see
the man with the wind in his hair

and my aunt say she has a tendency to fix

the sky with her eyes

Ghosts of the village hang here and there

and this’s jest

the wind blows against a wall

and the winds are a weight
and the sky is a line

and the line is black and orange and that’s jest

I hear a man muttering but I don’t see

the man with the wind in his hair

and I hear aunt say it’s jest

I hear aunt say it’s jest

Ghosts of the village hang here and there

and this’s jest

I hear aunt say the tide is red

and the tide is white

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

ghosts of the village hang here and there

And I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

I hear aunt say its jest

The Last Time I Slept by Ken Pilon

This is
the piece of the night
when
I’m asleep and
there’s a
dance, a
grunge,
the kisses
of children

I can’t remember
the name of
or even
where I’ve been

and would
ever get there

again,
I’ll
sleep
like a
good pillow,

my head
will
be up
and I
will
be
at
the window

with the
teeth
of a girl

and the
peony
inside
of a girl

That’s
my

favorite
song
I
was assigned
to write

so I’ll
write
this
chicory

I’ll
write
this
chicory

I’ll
write
all
the
titanium
through
my

cheek
but
I’ve
seen
a
girl
play
a
bump
a
bump
a
bump

I’m
not
a
girl
I’ll
just

get up
and
get
on
with
my
life

The State of One by Joseph Spece

When you hear the sea,
Learn to say
“I will go with it,”
Or “I will sit with it,”
And not “I am.”

When you hear the wind,
Learn to say
“I will put out the path
into the wind,
and not “I’m.”

When you hear the sea,
Learn to say
“I will go with it,”
In any order,

And not “I’m.”
But “I’m.”
When you hear the sea,
Learn to say
“I will go with it,”
And not “I’m.”

The Corporation by Marjorie Pickthall

We are so practical.
We invent greater loves.

We appoint our own.
We forget to take our own.

We put our own thoughts
in a new ad,

We return the favor.
We like to be at the center of something.

We lie, we steal, we do.
We can handle anything.

We are stars, not the Moon.
We aren’t stars,

we are stars, we are stars,

we are stars, we are stars,
we’re stars.

I am going to be invisible
in a sky that resembles a

From the air

In the Dead of Winter by John W. Chu

In the winter of some dead people's lives
I was coming back to myself

and this begins to sound like a poem
but I already knew it

was a poem and in order to know it
one must be born again

or else they’re just words

in the sense that they tell us
that somewhere in the darkness

there was a man who used to live
a long time ago

or else he was a dog

or something else entirely

like a mouse

or a death mask

or a flighty bird

or a bat

or a bat with a whip

or a sword 

or a sickle

or something else entirely
I mean to say

I do not know

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Yehuda Amichai

We pressed him with our hands and gave him a taste

of tortilla, of steak, of chicken. We hung his head.

We made him sit on the bed

and watched him watch us watch him

kiss like a donkey

and eat like an emaciated duck,

and then he’d beg for more,

and we’d take him back.

We were so proud of him

we didn’t even have to wait for the

autumn call. I saw my mother

open her house to the wind, and it was like

an armada of airplanes

was going to the beach, and then

someone was going to the beach,

and the wind was like an armada of airplanes

was coming back to you.

The Children by Richard Wilbur

The kids in the back of the truck
or the couple in the back
with their dog
are the dead. There’s nothing to do

in the cabbage field. The cows
are still eating the cabbage
and it’s not for lack of love.

No, it’s that my kids are
dead to us. They’re just

like the ones in the van
in the ditch. They have their
own issues like luggage,

a stroller, a car seat,
and teachers, whose hands

aren’t on the table
or the carpet. I have to move

to read my book and I’ve got
a book to read on my hands.

The kids are dead. I won’t

have my own grandson
because he is too young.

The time has come for me
to go back into the classroom
and sit with students
and talk with them.

How can I be so stubborn
to the point of being
a hindrance to all of this?

The Turning Point in a Story by Kim Addonizio

It was when she thought
she might be alone

or at least not pretending
to be someone else

or at least calling it quits

that she killed herself.

She was in a bad mood
that day and night

but planning her escape

that day and night
with the help of a joke

from her mother.

The joke was often
overly sentimental

or simply terrible

when she was laughing,
but often was

or was about to be

so when her mother said
“You have to tell
your kids things in the past

she meant it,
and so that was

that.

Re-reading by Sarah McLane

When I was ten, in the last book
of my mother's collection,
I found myself in a forest

where a leaf was dangling
from a branch, stuck

to the blackness of the night,
and I saw myself

in the hands
of an old man, holding

a first edition of the Bible
he had just read. I saw

a black face
next to a man

who looked like he had spent
his whole life in this country and

I told myself, “What does this teach me?”
I wanted to know how the Bible

was about to end,
how the black community

needed to be freed,
what do I do now?

“What do you do now?”

The Lost Book of the Future by Gabriel Spera

I won’t give the book it holds
until its pages rustle and my eyes close.
I won’t look at the page that’s unfolded.
I won’t lay the thing down in the book
so it will lose its shape. I won’t open it,
wringing it like the thin, fossilized hand
a child made in a drawer. Like how
a child who can’t read may wrap it
around its fingers and read it
but when the book is yours,
all you do is open the book,
read the name on the cover,
and you will be the book.

By the Sea by James Ellsworth

On the shore, by the sea,
My dear, where’st thou gone?
The whole world is drowned
For thy sake, for my life.

A stranger and a stranger
Shall set a strange catch
For thy love; and my heart
Joyfully shall be contented, if I
Shall be trusted for that.

O, though that be not
Our true story, yet it is
Thou’st done from us;
For thou hast the gift of a sweet
Heart, and of no fear.

Are You the One by Peter Campion

I’m searching the house
for my watch, or it’s the splinter
of my father’s watch, found
or lost on the kitchen table,
or the dresser drawer
where it belonged.

And no, I’m not
adventuring here. I’m
in a public library
in a large, messy room
where the other books
are on the shelves.

I’ve never been
in public
before. I’ve always
called a cab
or waited
for a friend who was free.

I’m in love with
this sweater I’ve found
on a shelf
in a corner
but I have to buy
a dozen pairs
to wear tonight.

I’ll try

“Ode to my Italian girlfriend” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Ode to my Italian girlfriend,
She is a beautiful girl,
The car looked fancy in Italian
So she walked in German
With English accent.

She was a genius
At putting gum in the cup
To suck the smell of Italian wine.

She wanted to be a poet
But would not walk in Italian
With English accent,

She was a genius
At combining parts
To make a diving suit,

She was a genius
At reading poems in Italian,
The car looked fancy in Italian,

She was a genius,
And loved to read poems in Italian,
With English accent,

She was a genius,
And loved to read poems in Italian,
With Italian accent,

The car looked fancy in Italian,
Translated from the German
She wanted to be a poet,

The founders of the company
And the talented students
All spoke with Italian accents.

Don’t be shy,
Admit it’s true,
You’re beautiful,
The car smelled fancy in Italian,

You’re a genius,
And loved to read poems in Italian,
Translated from the German,

Don’t be shy,
Admit it’s true,
You’re beautiful,
The car smelled fancy in Italian,

The founders of the company
And the brilliant students
All spoke with Italian accents.

The Lighthouse by William Carlos Williams

One woman came to tell the story,
and by way of condolence I’d promised
to go with her. I was tall as a heliotrope,
courted in a skirt of black silk, ornamented
by a jacquard of blistered roses. Her eyes glinted with disgust
or pity; I’d seep into every flower’s breeze
to capture the scent of black and something else,
the heat, the sharpness. I’d find a rose bush,
run my fingers over its petals, see
the scent of what I’d forgotten, saw
the slant blade of grass as hipper
as a car's tires, as my mother’d
wind her guitar strings, and we were on the way home.

The Right Thing by Jane Hirshfield

You can’t see the face in the mirror
but you can’t forget the name.

It’s the same name we give to clothes
or put down the dishes. The exact same thing

has happened to us, I was told.

It’s easier to get lost
than to find a parking spot

and for those of us with children,
it’s easier to get lost
than to fix our hair.

Before you know it,
some clown on the bus had

played you a trick:

it’s like in W.

Dear God, I Am Not
Aunt Molly

the first time you
attempted to kiss me,

my friend turned around
and I saw

that you’ve forgotten your hat.

Harmony by Bob Hulme

The nation must know what it knows;
It must know from the past
Which ravages the earth among us
With weapons never seen before,
The ways of the mind
Which must not be forgotten,
The power to love richly,
The mind of the great one
Whose only words are love.

A mighty spirit is assembling
On the plains of Africa,
That inexhaustible force
Must be given to its work,
And the great one,
Who says, “I am my own boss,
I am my own officer,
I am my own soldier,
I’ll do everything by me,
“doesn’t it’t?”

It is always more important
That we should love each other
Than it is possible to love,
Especially when it is possible.

Rage of the Tiger by Jennifer Zloteno

The one year old asked,How can I not be a tiger?  Na,man, a tiger is not a man.  Na,man, a tiger can kill a tiger.

We decided it was best to leave the house, go to the nearby woods,
where the tigers often roamed looking for humans.

We walked over a rocky bridge,
appointed ourselves a corner and sat on a log.

Suddenly a small tiger made the transition,
reaching up for my shoulder and pulling me

into the air. We were carried by the wind
across the prairie to a clearing on a fir

where the animals had gathered.

Six tigers with their tails and the bronto fleece
were waiting for us.  The one year old
pulled me by the collar

and I turned my head so there were six
unfurled tigers coming at me.

The Lucky Pie by Wendy Videlock

She loves the pie, but I’m not entirely certain I fell in love
with the pie, or what was the cause for it, or my own
inexhaustible desire to have it, and loved it, till I could not,
for reasons I cannot explain, control myself from loving it, and after
there was a nice big pie, and then I ate it, and I’ve had
another since I have been alive, and I remember the pie, but
not for love of it, or for its innards. It’s hard to be sure you’ve
been through the ringer, because the great weather is so absent
and the sun is so red, and the streets so painted all
white, and the people so distant, and I have no grave,
and I have no shirt and no bed and I am not the greatest.

The Bodhisattvas by Rivka Zacharias

The bony mass
of a bony foot

Above my head

I am a man I have been

Somehow

When I find

a tree

I will call

that tree brother

The feet

I will call

The real voice

The face

Of a man

I will call

“God”

Of a word

When I call

My father

“son”

Of a tree

I will call

The home

of a man

Who is

a growing man

Who walks

Up to the roots
of the tree

And lays the blue sheet

Into the ground.

The real voice

Will be

The wind

Of this life

Will be

The love

Of a man

Will be

The light

Of the tree

The first land

With every rain

The dust

Of this life

This clothing

Of this man

This robe

And this hat

And this cloth

Of this man

He is my father

The Autograph by Joyce Sutphen

I never quite understood the autograph,
her voice from the front, a head taller than the bottom of my step,
a hind foot, and a small black shoe,
her smile, to be Bill’s
look like a hard cold shoe
with a hard freezing heel,
her effortless stiffness, the way she
stopped to turn around,
her general grace and civility,
I wanted to give her credit,
just give her a picture,
and ask for a signature,
like everyone else,
and mumble, "Thank you."

Grave robbers, the wrong-doers,
those who mocked the living,
have not left my house
nor taken my jewels,
but I know what will happen:
I will go back and forth in the streets of Montreal
with my money,
I will always be where I was born,
a poor, timorous boy,
carried away by the streetcar,
and in a place like this,
I will always be hungry.

It is not a carelessness—
it is a vanity—
of my body,
I have not what it takes,
to be me—
but tall, black,
and fat,
I will stay where I am born
and then,
I will walk the streets of Montreal
with my money,
carrying clear bags
and my jewels,
and remembering
I was born in Montreal,
and this is my home,
where I will stay
and be rich forever—
and beautiful.

You Are My Prayer by Barbara Guest

You are my prayer,
you are my money
and honestly,
you are the reason
(for my pain)
I am alive.

You are the reason
(for my joy)
I have the eyes
to see my own.

You are the reason
(for my love)
I am loved.

You are the reason
(for my friend)
I am remembered.

You are my life,
you are my daily bread.

You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever found.

You are the reason
(for my fear)
within me is
nothing.

A Lady's Commerci
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Jacob Revell

I

Wear, love, this gown of my death.
It's stained, my coat, my shoes, my hair
fall.—I've spent the day at the blacksmith's,
have cut my hair, I've gotten a haircut.

I've been out in the yard, the treehouse, the town.
I've been outside the house, walking,
down the back road, to the store, shopping.

I've been watching birds, seeing ghosts,
seeing the sunset. Dark as a room,
dark as a bed.

Does love have blue eyes?
Does bread have bones?
Does wine have air?

Does the moon have a belly?
Does wine, hands, have hands?
Does love have a stillness?

Does the camera, the pictures, the music, the lights?
Does love have a voice?
Does love have a face?

Does the moon have eyes?
Does the moon have ears?

Does love have eyes?
Does wine, hands, have hands?
Does love, hands, have hands?

Does the moon have a face?
Does love have a heart?
Does the moon, hands, have hearts?

Does love have a voice?
Does wine, hands, have hands?
Does the moon have eyes?

Does the moon have wings?
Does love, hands, have hands?
Does love, hands, have hands?

Does the sky have a face?
Does wine, hands, have hands?

A Story I Am Not
 
 
  
   Launch Audio in a New Window by Suzette Petrosino

When I was a child and you were a wall,
I did not know what truck you’re driving.

I was not afraid and not familiar.

I heard your footsteps,
and I was hurt.

I am not the child who cannot run
or who is changed by fear,

the child who is always
ready to walk into the door
and leave.

I was not the one who did not know
when to say "Doesn’t change,"

and walk away.

I was not the one who felt
the need to thank you

for the food I ate,
and for shelter from the night.

I was not worried,
nor was I ever
sure about anything

except that I wanted to help.

Mediums by Will Alfred

It is no secret
that I am a wizard of disguises
and passports to hide
my love of all things physical.
I’ve also been known to make fierce friends
who’ve spent a life
carefully avoiding me.
Will you let me in your flat?
Will you spare a beer for my birthday?
Will you let me be your boss?
Will you give me a ride to the fireworks?
Will you let me read at your table?
Will you let me watch your movie?
The only way I can tell you
is that I should probably not
ask you out, but I will anyway.

The Summer by William Butler Yeats

In vain we strive to make love,
Wishing to engage in a pure, candid,
True love of each other;
But our lovers, to their utter miss,
Have one foot in the grave.

What is love?
Love is barren lust,
A cold, bitter, and terrible love.

Have I not heard that a maiden
Sings sweetest songs if she can?
But my Lord, if I may,
And speak thus thick and fast,
And say also,

“If you will to love me”—
My Lord, if I may.

Beginnings by Phyllis Wright

When the Earth is young
the blood of the dinosaur
already covers the snow

and ice which is there
for the taking no longer
the whole thing becomes a place

to go into and out of
and the birds wait
for the sun to come up

and it is not the rain that is great
but the sky that changes

and can be turned around
but the frogs swim away.

The huge trench on the hill
is not the way to go
but it is the place to go

where you don’t peel back the snow
and the trench that is still

not the way to go but the sea
as a whole is an avenue

that leads to nowhere

The House of Life: 19 by Abraham Sutzkever

The truth is you were born into grief and death.
You were born with a mind
sharp as the depression of despair
on your belly. You were born to die.

And you were a lamb that dare not sleep.
You were a lamb that walked the lamb
that brought you from the sheep of your birth.

You were a lamb that drank the menstrual blood.
You were a lamb that had your tongue cut off.
You were a lamb that had your mother's heart.

[Spokeman] by Evelyn C. Baum

He said,
“This breeze from the west,
a light breeze from the east,

this breeze from the south,
a breeze from the north,

this breeze from the east,
a light breeze from the west

that’s blowing
over there.”

So, why is that also called

a breeze that blows over there?

A helicopter pads by and doesn’t notice
the fallen brick,

a truck wheels by and doesn’t notice
the broken sandcastle

you’re building,
but I don’t know which one,
the one that’s been

kept for later or
the one you sent

to the one you’ve forgotten.

Passion by Joyce Carol Oates

My tree was not a tree
but a slip of foam
at the foot of a hill.

I loved
the way a man climbed
a high branch
and watched

the long,
evanescent roots
with a gesture

of his trunk.
I hated

the way he
calmly walked
and,

through a hole in the ground,
saw the first

leaves falling
from an old oak.

He was wearing
a thin red coat

and he was leafing
with his children,

the children of his children.
"You never know
just where you'll end up

when you get here,"
he said to me,

and made a gesture
with his trunk.

Poet’s Lamps by Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson

I hear it in her voice
that once’d a man said
“I’m a poet”
but I’m not. I’m just
a reader with a taste for poetry.

It’s easy to go mad
in a scene like that,
or to be depressed.

It’s easy to be angry
by chance or
as a result of torture.

But at night I’m a kind
of flame that rises
dark and cool with a feeling
like I’m not so alone

and that reads a lot better
than the poem I should have written,
the poem that imagined
her being the one who’d do it,
the poem that would have been true

if I’d been a real person
like the one she was.

I am a siren
Kittens run amok

The summer

It is

a misfortune
to have dreams of

burning

“triumphs in front of me”

in the end
I will die

the sun will lift me

I will die
with a smile on my face

and my name behind me
and my name

I am the siren

A Girl by Joanne Kyger

How beautiful

I
It’s not fair to stop
gathering in the front yards
and changing clothes,

cozy with the smell of
a fine laundry.


It’s not fair to get
a bit carried away

with the rush of wet
the sands brushing against
the road or the parked cars’

dust, but it’s true,
the waves are pounding

always, and water

flickers by the windows
of houses, and I
see my future—the

big fluffy clouds
peeling back the layers of
the understory as a
good luck charm, a way

to say thank you
for all the rain that

washes over us
and all the rain that

never ends.

The House of Horrors by Amanda Jernigan

(she-wolf by the lake, she-wolf by the river)
I hid in a whisper
of the catacombs of my mother’s house
where I could not speak.

The house was one hell of a lot bigger than me.
It was four bedrooms, three baths, a deluxe kitchen,
a four-car garage, a bowling alley, a 100-room Gothic
hotel. It was open to the courtyard, and to the street.

I had written that I would not come back.
I stood up, never did.

My mother was not the first woman to leave
and I will not be the last.

At this moment I am planting a tree.
It’s not because I am scared of trees.
I’m not afraid of trees.

My mother was not the first woman to leave
and I will not be the last.

Nothing can wipe this cold off,

The River by Vivian Smith

What rises from the dark and seems green
is a man, hunched over a fish,
and the fish is the man.

As the river curls and eats through the house
it becomes a room and a song.

What can be said for the river
that stretches east into west, it is
a song, and what is said
for the river I do not know, it is
a man telling another man

to the river about the river.
The man starts to swim
but stops, however he may

and tells him about its journey
and the fish, and the man

has died. I could not cry
at the sight, but instead held my head
to my chest, sobbing, and said

I am sorry I did not say something
about the river, I did not say
something about the river.

There was never even a puddle
for the last fish to disappear into,
the darkness scissoring across my skin,
a river singing in a house that never sleeps.

About Hell by Victoria Chang

You were born in hell,

You’ve been known to my

and turn me into a carafe,
a lily after the fall.
You’re dressed in boots and a hat,
you’re leaping rocks,
and I feel you’re drunk.
You’re as good as I am,
you’re as godly,
and so I am not
sorry to be born in hell.

Everyday Life by Gail Mazur

Silence breeds silence, and, so it pains me,
I write from my desk. I'm in my kitchen
watching the news, turning pages
while the television with the remote
plays. The streetlamps are dim,
like the stone hallways, except
it's dark, and the keys aren't

just for walking: I've been up
for days, and there's no bed.
Even the dishes are under the sink,
like the pantry where the refrigerator
has been kept frozen
forever, if cold. The door
won't open, because I know
it's always closed, and I can hear
the footfallers outside. This is

morning. It’s dark, and I’m
ending up in the office, and
I feel stupid for leaving
today, but I have to
go home, because there’s no
door in this house, and
what I’m about to do is awful

on my own.

The staircase leading up to the attic has been changed

It’s not possible to say which of these rooms
has been most improved. Everything has been changed.

We are the beggar cats of the ground.
We dare not ask for bread, but to see
bread twice and be served.

We are the breath of the dead,

We are the voices of the dead
that no one hears. We are the perfect

Visions by William Whiston

But as for me, who am anointed one,
I have no use for these sirens, nor for the love-love demons
That must have a subject and a time and a place—
No, none, for I am the ideal of the nineteenth-century,
And I have never been one of those, nor the ideal of any,
But rather my name, my honor, my love, the longing
For both these longing, that all the rest of the world may know,
It is I who am far most assured of my own worth,
For I am wholly alone in my self-worth.

I am a mountain.

I am the naked eye
of a mountain.
I am the dead of my former self
sipping rain.

I am the trail of the mountain.
I am the run-down solitude of a mountain.

I am the bleak cell of my past self.
I am my own underbrush.
I’m no longer a mountain.

There's always the empty bed,

and make a scene.

I can’t be the only one who’d like
to escape, to grow up

and see the end of the world.

I’ve let it hang out
like a long-legged dog,

and I don’t know how to get it
out.

It is vanishing as though it’s a plant
I’ve planted by the house.

I will wade through the mud
and try, pretending I’m a snail:

I’ll bury my head in the thigh.

decent, that is, useful.
We always thought of the present

I told my father that I hated the present
as much as I hated the past.
I told him that the present
is the future, and always
is. He replied that the present
is the past, and always
is. The future is
never. It is
future- past. He was right.
He was wrong.

Poem by Gwendolyn Brooks

No one will know
what I’ve done to shame
myself in this life.

I do not know
what it is to be loved

unripped

and unharmed

as the wood was.

I’ve never seen
a woman all night,

or slept in a single bed

as my father did

and woke to find

mine empty and caked

on snow.

Maybe it’s time
to start chopping

and moving on

and no one
will be there

to hear the knots being made

of sweeter wine, the wiggles
of butter’s rise, the last notes

of the piano’s arc

before it could be heard

but in this day

when my daughter makes music

and sings it,

and we are sitting

talking about her,

it’s easy to look
back and see

nothing beneath
the light-skinned face

spreading across the room.

Oh, she’s grown

and mature,

and I know her

and I know

what’s in her heart.

The Flowers by Charles Hamilton Sorley

In the fields of June
The bull-eye flowers bloom
In summer.

On the branches
Rich herbs gather
Clusters of petal-white flowers

In bloom in April
In June.

The flower’s fragrance
Is like the scent of the air
Passed from the trees

In the fields of June
The flower’s fragrance

Bloom in April
In June.

When the sun goes down,
Blooming red roses
Bloom in the fields of June.

When the sun goes down,
The bulbs of roses
Flare up in the sun.

My dear,
Are you lying
Up there,
Blooming red roses?

“Build a little house under the bushel train by Harryette Mullen” by Dore Kiesselbach

Build a little house under the bushel train.
We could live here, in its wreckage
where bricks line the asphalt, and the wheels

are still beating on the engine.
On the many-many ridges of this ridge
we would describe ourselves “boring”.

A house under the bushel train
would be a good place for a bit of rest,

for a change of scenery, a sea of grass
to sit in a corner and drink coffee,

be the fire that never goes out,
a place of many small rooms,

a thing of wooden beams and a tongue
that moves with the mind.

Pristine by Amaudy

I looked at my hands and saw
plastic, shiny, lily-white,
edgy, and made-up.
I did not understand this mental illness.
I did not understand this carnal madness.

I tried to remove the lump
that had formed in my throat,
but I could not and would not.

The doctor said, “Your lips,
your hands, your eyes—”
I did not understand these mental illnesses.
I was angry at myself.

I reached for my vagina
and touched my body
with a bare hand,

but I could not make myself aware
that I had done this.

A Day at the Beach by Ted Kooser

I walked to the beach
and bought a $1,000 locket
for my two-year-old son
just for his birthday.

I was wearing
a light blue tank top
and sandals.

I’ve been to the beach
many times
and never
forgotten the locket.

I’ve walked for hours
with the locket
and never
drove home with it.

I’ve worn my sandal
and my hat
to the beach
and sometimes
the waves
have carried me
through the sand
with it.

I’ve walked to the beach
and then
walked home
where I’m always
clean and neat
and good looking
and happy

when I walk into
the kitchen
I’m always ready and
know what to do.

I walk into
the kitchen and
I’m always
going to get
my coffee
and my food in order
I’m always
going to do
the dishes
and clean
the sink
and do
the dishes
and clean
the sink
and then I
go back
and I’m usually
behind the counter
or in the kitchen
cleaning the sink
and then
I’m usually
making sure
the oven is turned
freezing
in the microwave
I’m
just
there.

The Sound of a Score by Melissa Damm

It's not the end,
it's not the beginning,
it's just the sound of scores,

scored on water.
There is no end


where the sound of a scoring train
is coming,

it's not the end,
it's not the beginning of the end,

it's just the sound of scores,
scored on water.

The sound of scores is
like the sound of scores

falling—it's not from the beginning—
it's coming.

It's like a train,
it's like a score,

it's coming.
It's the sound of scores

falling—it's not from the beginning,
it's coming.

It's like a score,
it's like a score,

it's coming.
It's the sound of scores

falling—it's not from the beginning,
it's from the end.

The Voice of the Red Dog by W. S. Merwin

Owls’ voice is not a living thing, but the trophy goes
down to the shore, the wind’s voice, the bush’s
voice, the division of our breath, the bird’s, and the animal —
it is all a part of a kind of dream, a dream. A where
I found myself in a heap of achy feathers, wet and
already dried, and staring into my own tears.

It was a pleasure to live that way, to hear my own voice, but
I do not live there. My voice is an aqueous
chicken bone in a Nigerian restaurant, tender as the
beef that was cooked as a trophy. The smell of beer
glues the old broken boots and socks into old shoes and socks
that come back to me in the alley of my house, and
I say to myself, why do I have to live there
with the tug of a soul? A spirit that I did not
know I had, that is not mine, and stands alone on
a brick of forgotten doorsteps and a broken
penmanship. A stranger in the middle of the night
with a painted face that insists I come
to his house, his arm in the way I am
saying, yes, yes, I will.

A Bihorn by A. F. Moritz

The snapping leaves are all in the bush.
Wind is a distant voice
in the heart of the night and the window
is open and the water is coming
and anger
is on the porch
and the bell
is ringing
and the moon is coming
and the door is sliding
and the bird is breathing
and the tree is light brown
I am at the gate with you
and the tree is high
and the birds are singing
I am at the gate with you

The First Fat Girl by Judy Grahn

I don’t know where my mind is, but I have a feeling I’m wandering.
I’m riding the subway with my suitcase, my shoes
and socks, my unwieldy hair and bags, through the dark.
I’m a princess, not in the sense that someone else
might be a princess—I’m genuinely a princess, the kind of princess
a child would love. I feel everything I see, hear, touch, feel.
I’m walking home with my friends, prepping my laundry,
trying to figure out how to get around, I’m trying to
make myself useful, I’m trying to make my plans.
And I’m at the mercy of the Universe:
something is always going to happen,
it’s just a matter of

waiting for my destiny to unfold.

The Dead by Arthur Sze

I can still hear
My mother’s voice
As she spoke
When she was dead.

I can walk
Across the room
Where she once slept,
And my heart will go
Whole again.

The dead man will
Be buried
In the back of the closet
That my father kept,

And the dead thing
Will be carried
Over the threshold
Of the old house
By the iron gate.

The dead man will
Be carried [over the threshold]
By the iron gate
By the iron gate.

I can still see
The dead man’s face
And the crow's
Falling from the sky,

And the crow’s
Falling from the sky,
And the dead man’s face,

And the dead thing’s
Falling from the sky,
And the crow’s,

And the crow’s falling from the sky,
And the dead thing’s
Falling from the sky,

And the crow’s falling from the sky,
And the dead man’s face.

Blood by Samiya Bashir

I am a woman
living in a house

I am an old woman
living in a house

I am a woman
sharing a bed.

I am a woman
who has no breasts.

I am a woman
kept in a box.

I am a woman
washing a cloth.

I am a woman
walking on a path.

I am a woman

I am so weary of my body.
I am seeing a woman's face.

I am a woman
and I am tired
of my body.

I am the woman in the picture.
I am non-binary.

My body
is eternally
transforming.

I am a woman living in a house.
I am always glad
that my body is eternally
transforming.

I am a woman living in a house.
I am old.

Madcap by Nancy Simpson

Darkness gathers
slowly on the pins in the sky.
Food, sleep, a chance to dream
Farewell! Heaven shall not save
The madcap who prays in the dark

And the madcap who prays in the daylight,
The madcap who prays in the dark and in the daylight,

The madcap who prays in the dark and in the daylight,

   Launch Audio in a New Window by Rebecca Wolff

in the great middle of a field
where no one always talks

the outer sky
spacial

knowing what we know

we are not aware
we are not aware

it is not understanding

not being aware

it is our silence

an inner silence
not knowing

going on

Blue at Night by Walter Clyde Curry

Blue at night the trees
turn and kissed
and blue at daybreak
the moon is blue and quiet

I am so hungry
I can’t sit down. I am hungry
to live by my own rules.

I can’t drink my own medicine.
I can’t take a shower alone,
I’m high on mushrooms and caffeine and all

I drink is water. I’m all
back to black and skinny. My clothes
are loaded with camo and fur.

I am dead and I will be
as dead.

A Little Closer to the Edge by Laura Kasischke

Unlike my brilliant best friend, who's been fighting the good fight
for years, I’ve never had a real boyfriend. I haven’t

came into this life expecting something else, something
or nothing. I was hoping for an epiphany, the revelation

of an outer road hidden under a pine tree. My mom said

she’d never seen a dead body. I understand. I’ve eaten

chicken fingers, forged my own medicine, and tried

to bury the hatchet with my mother, but I’ve

kept it back, and she’d keep it up, the way

I've always done, the kind of "I’m still here." I’m here

because I wanted to be, and I’m here still. I

remember the first time I lived here,

the first time I drank my share of water

on a Saturday night. I’m not smoking.

The Dream in the Fountain by Kate Greenstreet

We are a narrow circle of light
entering the drunken, cheap pool
and entering the world as a great big ball
grabs me and I, two square feet of me,

and the whole man, both hands
raised and grasping the ball, the whole body
and the whole useless, worthless, hungry me,

and the whole earth around me, blocks of me
and I am, beside myself with love
and nothing else. I am the unfinished glass,

piece of glass in the shape of a window
that looks out into the world and opens
an inner window that has no face,

a glass that looks out onto the glass
without face or face or face.

The Rat by Timothy Tocher

I have not left the house
without your scent, but you

have

no recollection
of me

and the noise impeded

from the street

as if you
couldn’t hear me

over the ruckus

of the street,

the noise

took everything

my tone

had

taken

from my voice

to mine

when I

started

dancing with you

I’d say

it’s

good

to be in London

and then

I’d say

He’s in London

and then

I’d go down

for dinner

that way

I’d get my

shopping list

and let it

go by

I’d

walk

through that

great hall

where

the music

was the only

thing

that moved me

to say

“You’re
“in
L.A.”

The Final Victim by Frederic James

The lute catches her head
and the night gambols,

shrill as a snake's.

A dark wood is
shivering in the breeze.

The devil (sadly)
has come down

to help us sing.

There is a sign
in a tree
that says,

“Live!”

You will die
of grief,

the old self
will climb
the rails,

stately,

eager to please
the crowd,

but if you
are brave,

you will escape,

forever returning
to the same place.

A flash from the last song
scuttles by

and you can’t hear it,
the song fades.

You will die
of grief,

the old self
will climb
the rails

and stay
in the dark wood
for eternity.
